Heron processing topologies can be written using an API called the **Heron Functional API**. The Heron Functional API is currently available for the following languages:

* [Java](../../../developers/java/functional-api)
<!-- * [Python](../../../developers/python/functional-api) -->

> Although the original [topology API](../../../concepts/topologies) can still be used with Heron (which means that all of your older topologies will still run) we strongly recommend creating all new topologies using the Heron Functional API, for reasons outlined in the section below.

## The Heron Functional API vs. the topology API

When Heron was first released, all Java topologies needed to be written using an API based on the [Storm topology API](../topologies). Although this API is quite powerful (and can still be used), the **Heron Functional API** enables you to create topologies without needing to implement spouts and bolts or connect spouts and bolts together.

Here are some crucial differences between the two APIs:

Domain | Original topology API | Heron Functional API
:------|:----------------------|:--------------------
Programming style | Procedural, processing component based | Functional
Abstraction level | **Low level**. Developers must think in terms of "physical" spout and bolt implementation logic. | **High level**. Developers can write processing logic in an idiomatic fashion in the language of their choice, without needing to write and connect spouts and bolts.
Processing model | [Spout](../spouts) and [bolt](../bolts) logic must be created explicitly, and connecting spouts and bolts is the responsibility of the developer | Spouts and bolts are created for you automatically on the basis of the processing graph that you build

The two APIs also have a few things in common:

* Topologies' [logical](../../../concepts/topologies#logical-plan) and [physical](../../../concepts/topologies#physical-plan) plans are automatically created by Heron
* Topologies are [managed](../../../operators/heron-cli) in the same way using the `heron` CLI tool
