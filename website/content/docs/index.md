title: Heron Documentation
description: Welcome!
---

Heron is a realtime analytics platform developed by Twitter. It is the direct
successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards
compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/tutorial.html)
but with a wide array of architectural improvements. For more on the
architecture and design goals of Heron, see [The Architecture of
Heron](concepts/architecture) and [Heron Topologies](concepts/topologies).
