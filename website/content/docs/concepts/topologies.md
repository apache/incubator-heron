A Heron **topology** is a [directed acyclic
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) used to process
streams of data. Topologies can be stateless or 
[stateful](../delivery-semantics#stateful-topologies) depending on your use case.

Heron topologies consist of two basic components:

* [Spouts](#spouts) inject data into Heron topologies, potentially from external sources like pub-sub messaging systems (Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc.)
* [Bolts](#bolts) apply user-defined processing logic to data supplied by spouts

Spouts and bolts are connected to one another via **streams** of data. Below is a
visual illustration of a simple Heron topology:

![Heron topology](/img/topology.png)

In the diagram above, spout **S1** feeds data to bolts **B1** and **B2** for
processing; in turn, bolt **B1** feeds processed data to bolts **B3** and
**B4**, while bolt **B2** feeds processed data to bolt **B4**. This is just a
simple example; you can create arbitrarily complex topologies in Heron.

## Creating topologies

There are currently two APIs available that you can use to build Heron topologies:

1. The higher-level [Heron Functional API](#the-heron-functional-api) (recommended for new topologies), which enables you to create topologies in a declarative, developer-friendly style inspired by functional programming concepts (such as map, flatMap, and filter operations)
1. The lower-level [topology API](#the-topology-api) (*not* recommended for new topologies), based on the original [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/about/simple-api.html) API, which requires you to specify spout and bolt logic directly

## Topology Lifecycle

Once you've set up a [Heron cluster](../../operators/deployment), you
can use Heron's [CLI tool](../../operators/heron-cli) to manage the entire
lifecycle of a topology, which typically goes through the following stages:

1. [Submit](../../operators/heron-cli#submitting-a-topology) the topology
   to the cluster. The topology is not yet processing streams but is ready to be
   activated.
2. [Activate](../../operators/heron-cli#activating-a-topology) the
   topology. The topology will begin processing streams in accordance with
   the topology architecture that you've created.
3. [Restart](../../operators/heron-cli#restarting-a-topology) an
   active topology if, for example, you need to update the topology configuration.
4. [Deactivate](../../operators/heron-cli#deactivating-a-topology) the
   topology. Once deactivated, the topology will stop processing but
   remain running in the cluster.
5. [Kill](../../operators/heron-cli#killing-a-topology) a topology to completely
   remove it from the cluster.  It is no longer known to the Heron cluster and
   can no longer be activated. Once killed, the only way to run that topology is
   to re-submit and re-activate it.

## Logical Plan

A topology's **logical plan** is analagous to a database [query
plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan) in that it maps out the basic
operations associated with a topology. Here's an example logical plan for the
example Functional API topology [below](#functional-api-example):

![Topology logical Plan](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/4e6e1ede-45f1-471f-b131-b3ecb7b7c3b5/image.png)

Whether you use the [Heron Functional API](#the-heron-functional-api) or the [topology
API](#the-topology-api), Heron automatically transforms the processing logic that
you create into both a logical plan and a [physical plan](#physical-plan).

## Physical Plan

A topology's **physical plan** is related to its logical plan but with the
crucial difference that a physical plan determines the "physical" execution
logic of a topology, i.e. how topology processes are divided between
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers. Here's a basic visual representation of a
physical plan:

![Topology Physical Plan](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/5c2fe0cb-e4cf-4192-9416-b1b64b5ce958/image.png)

In this example, a Heron topology consists of one [spout](#spouts) and five
different [bolts](#bolts) (each of which has multiple instances) that have automatically 
been distributed between five different Docker containers.

## The Heron Functional API

{{< alert "functional-api-beta" >}}

When Heron was first created, the model for creating topologies was deeply
indebted to the Apache Storm model. Under that model, developers creating topologies
needed to explicitly define the behavior of every spout and bolt in the topology.
Although this provided a powerful low-level API for creating topologies, that approach
presented a variety of drawbacks for developers:

* **Verbosity** --- In both the Java and Python topology APIs, creating spouts and bolts involved substantial boilerplate, requiring developers to both provide implementations for spout and bolt classes and also specify the connections between those spouts and bolts. This often led to the problem of...
* **Difficult debugging** --- When spouts, bolts, and the connections between them need to be created "by hand," a great deal of cognitive load
* **Tuple-based data model** --- In the older topology API, spouts and bolts passed tuples and nothing but tuples within topologies. Although tuples are a powerful and flexible data type, the topology API forced *all* spouts and bolts to serialize or deserialize tuples.

In contrast with the topology API, the Heron Functional API offers:

* **Boilerplate-free code** --- Instead of re to implement spout and bolt classes, the Heron Functional API enables you to write functions, such as map, flatMap, join, and filter functions, instead.
* **Easy debugging** --- With the Heron Functional API, you don't have to worry about spouts and bolts, which means that you can more easily surface problems with your processing logic.
* **Completely flexible, type-safe data model** --- Instead of requiring that all processing components pass tuples to one another (which implicitly requires serialization to and deserializaton from your application-specific types), the Heron Functional API enables you to write your processing logic in accordance with whatever types you'd like---including tuples, if you wish. In the Functional API for [Java](../../developers/java/functional-api), all streamlets are typed (e.g. `Streamlet<MyApplicationType>`), which means that type errors can be caught at compile time rather than runtime.

### Heron Functional API topologies

With the Heron Functional API *you still create topologies*, but only implicitly. Heron
automatically performs the heavy lifting of converting the streamlet-based processing logic
that you create into spouts and bolts and, from there, into containers that are then deployed using
whichever [scheduler](../../operators/deployment) your Heron cluster is using.

From the standpoint of both operators and developers [managing topologies'
lifecycles](#topology-lifecycle), the resulting topologies are equivalent. From a
development workflow standpoint, however, the difference is profound.

TODO: add this when the Java DSL doc is published

### Available languages

The Heron Functional API is currently available in the following languages:

* [Java](../../developers/java/functional-api)

-->

### Streamlets

The core construct underlying the Heron Functional API is that of the **streamlet**. A streamlet is
a potentially unbounded, ordered collection of tuples. Streamlets can originate from a
wide variety of sources, such as pub-sub messaging systems like [Apache
Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.incubator.apache.org)
(incubating), random generators, or static files like CVS or Parquet files.

#### Streamlet operations

In the Heron Functional API, processing data means *transforming streamlets into other
streamlets*. This can be done using a wide variety of available operations, including
many that you may be familiar with from functional programming:

Operation | Description
:---------|:-----------
map | Returns a new streamlet by applying the supplied mapping function to each element in the original streamlet
flatMap | Like a map operation but with the important difference that each element of the streamlet is flattened
join | Joins two separate streamlets into a single streamlet
filter | Returns a new streamlet containing only the elements that satisfy the supplied filtering function

### Functional API example

You can see an example streamlet-based processing graph in the diagram below:

![Streamlet-based processing graph for Heron](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/dc74f0b2-0d3d-46da-b80d-0bc70ad4f64c/image.png)

Here's the corresponding Java code for the processing logic shown in the diagram:

```java
package heron.dsl.example;

import com.twitter.heron.dsl.*;
import com.twitter.heron.dsl.impl.BaseStreamlet;

import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public final class ExampleFunctionalAPITopology {
    public ExampleFunctionalAPITopology() {}

    private int randomInt(int lower, int upper) {
        return ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(lower, upper + 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Builder builder = Builder.CreateBuilder();

        builder.newSource(() -> 0)
                .setName("zeroes");

        builder.newSource(() -> randomInt(1, 10))
                .setName("random-ints")
                .map(i -> i + 1)
                .setName("add-one")
                .union(zeroes)
                .setName("unify-streams")
                .filter(i -> i != 2)
                .setName("remove-all-twos")
                .log();

        Config conf = new Config();
        conf.setNumContainers(2);

        new Runner().run("ExampleFunctionalAPITopology", conf, builder);
    }
}
```

That Java code will produce this [logical plan](#logical-plan):

### Key-value streamlets

In order to perform some operations, such as streamlet joins and streamlet reduce operations, you'll need to create **key-value** streamlets.

## Partitioning

In the topology API, processing parallelism can be managed via adjusting the number of spouts and bolts performing different operations, enabling you to, for example, increase the relative parallelism of a bolt by using three of that bolt instead of two.

The Heron Functional API provides a different mechanism for controlling parallelism: **partitioning**. To understand partitioning, keep in mind that rather than physical spouts and bolts, the core processing construct in the Heron Functional API is the processing step. With the Heron Functional API, you can explicitly assign a number of partitions to each processing step in your graph (the default is one partition).

The example topology [above](#streamlets), for example, has five steps:

* the random integer source
* the "add one" map operation
* the union operation
* the filtering operation
* the logging operation.

You could apply varying numbers of partitions to each step in that topology like this:

```java
Builder builder = Builder.CreateBuilder();

builder.newSource(() -> 0)
        .setName("zeroes");

builder.newSource(() -> ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(1, 11))
        .setName("random-ints")
        .setNumPartitions(3)
        .map(i -> i + 1)
        .setName("add-one")
        .setNumPartitions(3)
        .union(zeroes)
        .setName("unify-streams")
        .setNumPartitions(2)
        .filter(i -> i != 2)
        .setName("remove-all-twos")
        .setNumPartitions(2)
        .log();
```

The number of partitions to assign to each processing step when using the Functional API depends
on a variety of factors.

## Windowing

Window configurations have two core components:

1. The length of the window

> In the Heron DSL, all window lengths and sliding intervals are specified **in seconds**.

### Sliding windows

In a sliding time window, tuples

## Resource allocation with the Heron Functional API

When creating topologies using the Functional API, there are three types of resources that you can specify:

1. The number of containers into which the topology's [physical plan](#physical-plan) will be split
1. The total number of CPUs allocated to be used by the topology
1. The total amount of RAM allocated to be used by the topology

For each topology, there are defaults for each resource type:

Resource | Default | Minimum
:--------|:--------|:-------
Number of containers | 1 | 1
CPU | 1.0 | 1.0
RAM | 512 MB | 192MB

<!-- TODO: For instructions on allocating resources to topologies, see ... -->

## Spouts

A Heron **spout** is a source of streams, responsible for emitting
[tuples](../../developers/data-model) into the topology. A spout may, for
example, read data from a Kestrel queue or read tweets from the Twitter API and
emit tuples to one or more bolts.

Information on building spouts can be found in [Building
Spouts](../../developers/java/spouts).

## Bolts

A Heron **bolt** consumes streams of
[tuples](../../developers/data-model) emitted by spouts and performs some
set of user-defined processing operations on those tuples, which may include
performing complex stream transformations, performing storage operations,
aggregating multiple streams into one, emitting tuples to other bolts within the
topology, and much more.

Information on building bolts can be found in [Building
Bolts](../../developers/java/bolts).

## Data Model

Heron's original topology API required using a fundamentally tuple-driven data model.
You can find more information in [Heron's Data Model](../../developers/data-model).
