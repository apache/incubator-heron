### Contributing to Heron
Community is a critical factor to the success of Heron.  Contributions are welcome! After reviewing
the [Heron Architecture](../../concepts/architecture/), [Compiling Heron](../../developers/compiling/compiling/),
and the [Heron Codebase](../codebase/), this page covers how to contribute and, when you've made a
patch, how to submit it.

### How can I contribute to Heron?

In general, contributions that fix bugs or add features (as opposed to stylistic, refactoring, or
"cleanup" changes) are preferred. Please check the dev list before investing a lot of time in a patch.

Continue to [Heron Architecture](../../concepts/architecture/),
[Compiling Heron](../../developers/compiling/compiling/), or [Heron Codebase](../codebase/).

### Patch Acceptance Process
1.  Please read the Heron [governance plan](../governance).

2. Discuss your plan and design, and get agreement on our heron-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list.

3. Prepare a GitHub commit that implements the feature. Don't forget to add tests.

<!--
4. TODO - pre commit process (travis-ci)
--> 

4. Complete a code review with a core contributor using the heron-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list. Amend your existing commit and re-push to make changes to your patch.

5. An engineer at Twitter applies the patch to our internal version control system.
