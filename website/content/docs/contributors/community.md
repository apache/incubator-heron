### Contributing to Heron
We welcome contributions! After reviewing the [Architecture of Heron](../../concepts/architecture/), [Compiling Heron](../../developers/compiling/compiling/), and the [Heron Codebase](../codebase/), this page covers how to contribute and, when you've made a patch, how to submit it.

### How can I contribute to Heron?

In general, we prefer contributions that fix bugs or add features (as opposed to stylistic, refactoring, or "cleanup" changes). Please check with us on the dev list before investing a lot of time in a patch.
