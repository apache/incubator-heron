### Contributing to Heron
Community is a critical factor to the success of Heron.  Contributions are welcome! After reviewing the [Heron Architecture](../../concepts/architecture/), [Compiling Heron](../../developers/compiling/compiling/), and the [Heron Codebase](../codebase/), this page covers how to contribute and, when you've made a patch, how to submit it.

### How can I contribute to Heron?

In general, contributions that fix bugs or add features (as opposed to stylistic, refactoring, or "cleanup" changes) are preferred. Please check the dev list before investing a lot of time in a patch.
