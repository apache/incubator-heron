title: Setting Up S3 Uploader
---

If you are running in Amazon AWS, Heron provides out of the box uploader for S3,
the object storage. S3 uploader is useful when the topologies run in a distributed
cluster of Amazon EC2 compute instances. Since S3 replicates the data, it provides
a scalable mechanism for distributing the user topology jars.

### S3 Uploader Configuration

You can make Heron use S3 uploader by modifying the `uploader.yaml` config file specific
for the Heron cluster. You'll need to specify the following for each cluster:

* `heron.class.uploader` --- Indicate the uploader class to be loaded. You should set this
to `com.twitter.heron.uploader.s3.S3Uploader`

* `heron.uploader.s3.bucket` --- Specifies the S3 bucket where the topology jar should be
uploaded.

* `heron.uploader.s3.access_key` --- Specify the access key of the AWS account that has
write access to the bucket

* `heron.uploader.s3.secret_key` --- Specify the secret access of the AWS account that has
write access to the bucket

### Example S3 Uploader Configuration

Below is an example configuration (in `uploader.yaml`) for a S3 uploader:

```yaml
# uploader class for transferring the topology jar/tar files to storage
heron.class.uploader: com.twitter.heron.uploader.s3.S3Uploader

# S3 bucket to put the jar file into
heron.uploader.s3.bucket: heron-topologies-company-com

# AWS access key
heron.uploader.s3.access_key: access_key

# AWS secret access key
heron.uploader.s3.secret_key: secret_access_key
```
