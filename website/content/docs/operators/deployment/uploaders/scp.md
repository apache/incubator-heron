title: Setting Up SCP Uploader
---

For small clusters with simple setups that doesn't have a HDFS like file system, the SCP uploader
can be used to manage the package files. This uploader uses the `scp` linux command to upload the
files to a node accessible by all the worker nodes in the cluster. Then a scheduler like Aurora can
use the `scp` command again to download the content to each of the worker machines.

SCP Uploader requirements

* SCP uploader requires the `scp` and `ssh` linux utilities installed. Also it is better to have
passwordless ssh configured between the shared node and worker nodes in the cluster.

### SCP Uploader Configuration

You can make Heron use SCP uploader by modifying the `uploader.yaml` config file specific
for the Heron cluster. You'll need to specify the following for each cluster:

* `heron.class.uploader` --- Indicate the uploader class to be loaded. You should set this to
com.twitter.heron.uploader.scp.ScpUploader
* `heron.uploader.scp.command.options` --- Part of the SCP command where you specify custom options.
i.e "-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
* `heron.uploader.scp.command.connection` --- The user name and host pair to be used by the SCP command.
i.e "user@host"
* `heron.uploader.ssh.command.options` --- Part of the SSH command where you specify custom options.
i.e "-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
* `heron.uploader.ssh.command.connection` --- The user name and host pair to be used by the SSH command.
i.e "user@host"
* `heron.uploader.scp.dir.path` --- The directory to be used to uploading the package.

### Example SCP Uploader Configuration

Below is an example configuration (in `uploader.yaml`) for a SCP uploader:

```yaml
# uploader class for transferring the topology jar/tar files to storage
heron.class.uploader:         com.twitter.heron.uploader.scp.ScpUploader
# This is the scp command options that will be used by the uploader, this can be used to
# specify custom options such as the location of ssh keys.
heron.uploader.scp.command.options:   "-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
# The scp connection string sets the remote user name and host used by the uploader.
heron.uploader.scp.command.connection:   "user@host"

# The ssh command options that will be used when connecting to the uploading host to execute
# command such as delete files, make directories.
heron.uploader.ssh.command.options:   "-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
# The ssh connection string sets the remote user name and host used by the uploader.
heron.uploader.ssh.command.connection:   "user@host"

# the directory where the file will be uploaded, make sure the user has the necessary permissions
# to upload the file here.
heron.uploader.scp.dir.path:   ${HOME}/heron/repository/${CLUSTER}/${ROLE}/${TOPOLOGY}
```

The uploader will use SSH to create the entire directory structure specified in `heron.uploader.scp.dir.path` 
by running `mkdir -p` before using SCP to upload the topology package.


Below is an example `scp` command configuration in the `heron.aurora` file. The cmdline is run by every node
in the cluster to **download** the topology package.

```bash
fetch_user_package = Process(
  name = 'fetch_user_package',
  cmdline = 'scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host:%s %s && tar zxf %s' % (heron_topology_jar_uri, \
      topology_package_file, topology_package_file)
)
```
