title: Running Heron via Docker Containers on Nomad
---

Below are instructions on how to run Heron on Nomad via docker containers.  In this mode, Heron executors will run as docker containers on host machines.

## Requirements

When setting up your Nomad cluster, the following are required:

* The [Heron CLI tool](../../../heron-cli) must be installed on each machine used to deploy Heron topologies
* Python 2.7, Java 7 or 8, and [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) must be installed on every machine in the cluster
* A [ZooKeeper cluster](https://zookeeper.apache.org)
* Docker installed and enabled on every machine
* Each machine must also be able to pull the official Heron docker image from DockerHub or have the image preloaded.

## Configuring Heron settings

Before running Heron via Nomad, you'll need to configure some settings. Once you've [installed Heron](../../../../getting-started), all of the configurations you'll need to modify will be in the `~/.heron/conf/nomad` diredctory.

First, make sure that the `heron.nomad.driver` is set to "docker" in `~/.heron/conf/nomad/scheduler.yaml` e.g.

```yaml
heron.nomad.driver: "docker"
```

You can also adjust which docker image to use for running Heron via the `heron.executor.docker.image` in `~/.heron/conf/nomad/scheduler.yaml` e.g.

```yaml
heron.executor.docker.image: 'heron/heron:latest'
```

You'll need to use a topology uploader to deploy topology packages to nodes in your cluster. You can use one of the following uploaders:

* The HTTP uploader in conjunction with Heron's [API server](../../../heron-api-server). The Heron API server acts like a file server to which users can upload topology packages. The API server distributes the packages, along with the Heron core package, to the relevant machines. You can also use the API server to submit your Heron topology to Nomad (described [below](#deploying-with-the-api-server)) <!-- TODO: link to upcoming HTTP uploader documentation -->
* [Amazon S3](../../uploaders/s3). Please note that the S3 uploader requires an AWS account.
* [SCP](../../uploaders/scp). Please note that the SCP uploader requires SSH access to nodes in the cluster.

You can modify the `heron.class.uploader` parameter in `~/.heron/conf/nomad/uploader.yaml` to choose an uploader.

In addition, you must update the `heron.statemgr.connection.string` parameter in the `statemgr.yaml` file in `~/.heron/conf/nomad` to your ZooKeeper connection string. Here's an example:

```yaml
heron.statemgr.connection.string: 127.0.0.1:2181
```

Then, update the `heron.nomad.scheduler.uri` parameter in `scheduler.yaml` to the URL of the Nomad server to which you'll be submitting jobs. Here's an example:

```yaml
heron.nomad.scheduler.uri: http://127.0.0.1:4646
```

## Submitting Heron topologies to the Nomad cluster

You can submit Heron topologies to a Nomad cluster via the [Heron CLI tool](../../../heron-cli):

```bash
$ heron submit nomad \
  <topology package path> \
  <topology classpath> \
  <topology CLI args>
```

Here's an example:

```bash
$ heron submit nomad \
  ~/.heron/examples/heron-streamlet-examples.jar \           # Package path
  org.apache.heron.examples.api.WindowedWordCountTopology \ # Topology classpath
  windowed-word-count                                        # Args passed to topology
```

## Deploying with the API server

The advantage of running the [Heron API Server](../../../heron-api-server) is that it can act as a file server to help you distribute topology package files and submit jobs to Nomad, so that you don't need to modify the configuration files mentioned above.  By using Heronâ€™s API Server, you can set configurations such as the URI of ZooKeeper and the Nomad server once and not need to configure each machine from which you want to submit Heron topologies.

## Running the API server

You can run the Heron API server on any machine that can be reached by machines in your Nomad cluster via HTTP. Here's a command you can use to run the API server:

```bash
$ ~/.heron/bin/heron-apiserver \
  --cluster nomad \
  --base-template nomad \
  -D heron.statemgr.connection.string=<ZooKeeper URI> \
  -D heron.nomad.scheduler.uri=<Nomad URI> \
  -D heron.class.uploader=org.apache.heron.uploader.http.HttpUploader \
  --verbose
```

You can also run the API server in Nomad itself, but you will need to have a local copy of the Heron API server executable on every machine in the cluster. Here's an example Nomad job for the API server:

```hcl
job "apiserver" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"
  group "apiserver" {
    count = 1
    task "apiserver" {
      driver = "raw_exec"
      config {
        command = <heron_apiserver_executable>
        args = [
        "--cluster", "nomad",
        "--base-template", "nomad",
        "-D", "heron.statemgr.connection.string=<zookeeper_uri>",
        "-D", "heron.nomad.scheduler.uri=<scheduler_uri>",
        "-D", "heron.class.uploader=org.apache.heron.uploader.http.HttpUploader",
        "--verbose"]
      }
      resources {
        cpu    = 500 # 500 MHz
        memory = 256 # 256MB
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the following:

* `<heron_apiserver_executable>` --- The local path to where the [Heron API server](../../../heron-api-server) executable is located (usually `~/.heron/bin/heron-apiserver`)
* `<zookeeper_uri>` --- The URI for your ZooKeeper cluster
* `<scheduler_uri>` --- The URI for your Nomad server

## Using the Heron API server to distribute Heron topology packages

Heron users can upload their Heron topology packages to the Heron API server using the HTTP uploader by modifying the `uploader.yaml` file to including the following:

```yaml
# uploader class for transferring the topology jar/tar files to storage
heron.class.uploader:    org.apache.heron.uploader.http.HttpUploader
heron.uploader.http.uri: http://localhost:9000/api/v1/file/upload
```

## Integration with Consul for metrics
Each container part of a Heron topology serves metrics out of a port randomly generated by Nomad.  Thus, Consul is needed for service discovery for users to determine which port the container is serving the metrics out of.
Every Heron executor running in a docker container will automatically register itself as a service with Consul given that there is a Consul cluster running. The port Heron will be serving metrics will be registered with Consul.
  
The service will be registered with the name with the following format:

```yaml
metrics-heron-<TOPOLOGY_NAME>-<CONTAINER_INDEX>
```

Each heron executor registered with Consul will be tagged with

```yaml
<TOPOLOGY_NAME>-<CONTAINER_INDEX>
```

To add additional tags, please add specify them in a comma delimited list via

```yaml
heron.nomad.metrics.service.additional.tags
```

in `scheduler.yaml`. For example:

```yaml
heron.nomad.metrics.service.additional.tags: "prometheus,metrics,heron"
```

Users can then configure Prometheus to scrape metrics for each container based on these tags
