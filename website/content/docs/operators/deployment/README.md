# Deploying Heron

Heron is designed to be run in clustered, scheduler-driven environments. It
currently supports three scheduler options out of the box:

* [Aurora](../aurora)
* [Mesos](../mesos)
* [Local scheduler](../local)

To implement a new scheduler, see
[Implementing a Custom Scheduler](../../../contributors/custom-scheduler).
