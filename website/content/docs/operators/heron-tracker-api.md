### JSON Interface

All Heron Tracker endpoints return a JSON object with the following information:

* `status` --- One of the following: `success`, `failure`.
* `executiontime` --- The time taken to return the HTTP result, in seconds.
* `message` --- Some endpoints return special messages in this field for certain
  requests. Often, this field will be an empty string. A `failure` status will
  always have a message.
* `result` --- The result payload of the request. The contents will depend on
  the endpoint.
* `version` --- The Tracker API version.

cumulative value over the period of `interval` provided. On the other hand, `/metricstimeline`
endpoint will report minutely values for each metricname for each instance.

### <a name="metricsquery">Metrics Query Language</a>

Metrics queries are useful when some kind of aggregated values are required. For example,
to find the total number of tuples emitted by a spout, `SUM` operator can be used, instead
of fetching metrics for all the instances of the corresponding component, and then summing them.

#### Terminology

1. Univariate Timeseries --- A timeseries is called univariate if there is only one set
of minutely data. For example, a timeseries representing the sums of a number of timeseries
would be a univariate timeseries.
2. Multivariate Timeseries --- A set of multiple timeseries is collectively called multivariate.
Note that these timeseries are associated with their instances.

#### Operators

##### TS

```text
TS(componentName, instance, metricName)
```

Example:

```text
TS(component1, *, __emit-count/stream1)
```

Time Series Operator. This is the basic operator that is responsible for getting metrics from TMaster.
Accepts a list of 3 elements:

1. componentName
2. instance - can be "*" for all instances, or a single instance ID
3. metricName - Full metric name with stream id if applicable

Returns a univariate time series in case of a single instance id given, otherwise returns
a multivariate time series.

---

##### DEFAULT

```text
DEFAULT(0, TS(component1, *, __emit-count/stream1))
```
If the second operator returns more than one timeline, so will the
DEFAULT operator.

```text
DEFAULT(100.0, SUM(TS(component2, *, __emit-count/default))) <--
```
Second operator can be any operator

Default Operator. This operator is responsible for filling missing values in the metrics timeline.
Must have 2 arguments

1. First argument is a numeric constant representing the number to fill the missing values with
2. Second one must be one of the operators, that return the metrics timeline

Returns a univariate or multivariate time series, based on what the second operator is.

---

##### SUM

```text
SUM(TS(component1, instance1, metric1), DEFAULT(0, TS(component1, *, metric2)))
```

Sum Operator. This operator is used to take sum of all argument time series. It can have any number of arguments,
each of which must be one of the following two types:

1. Numeric constants, which will fill in the missing values as well, or
2. Operator, which returns one or more timelines

Returns only a single timeline representing the sum of all time series for each timestamp.
Note that "instance" attribute is not there in the result.

---

##### MAX

```text
MAX(100, TS(component1, *, metric1))
```

Max Operator. This operator is used to find max of all argument operators for each individual timestamp.
Each argument must be one of the following types:

1. Numeric constants, which will fill in the missing values as well, or
2. Operator, which returns one or more timelines

Returns only a single timeline representing the max of all the time series for each timestamp.
Note that "instance" attribute is not included in the result.

---

##### PERCENTILE

```text
PERCENTILE(99, TS(component1, *, metric1))
```

Percentile Operator. This operator is used to find a quantile of all timelines retuned by the arguments, for each timestamp.
This is a more general type of query similar to MAX. Note that `PERCENTILE(100, TS...)` is equivalent to `Max(TS...)`.
Each argument must be either constant or Operators.
First argument must always be the required Quantile.

1. Quantile (first argument) - Required quantile. 100 percentile = max, 0 percentile = min.
2. Numeric constants will fill in the missing values as well,
3. Operator - which returns one or more timelines

Returns only a single timeline representing the quantile of all the time series
for each timestamp. Note that "instance" attribute is not there in the result.

---

##### DIVIDE

```text
DIVIDE(TS(component1, *, metrics1), 100)
```

Divide Operator. Accepts two arguments, both can be univariate or multivariate.
Each can be of one of the following types:

1. Numeric constant will be considered as a constant time series for all applicable timestamps, they will not fill the missing values
2. Operator - returns one or more timelines

Three main cases are:

1. When both operands are multivariate
    1. Divide operation will be done on matching data, that is, with same instance id.
    2. If the instances in both the operands do not match, error is thrown.
    3. Returns multivariate time series, each representing the result of division on the two corresponding time series.
2. When one operand is univariate, and other is multivariate
    1. This includes division by constants as well.
    2. The univariate operand will participate with all time series in multivariate.
    3. The instance information of the multivariate time series will be preserved in the result.
    4. Returns multivariate time series.
3. When both operands are univariate
    1. Instance information is ignored in this case
    2. Returns univariate time series which is the result of division operation.

---

```text
MULTIPLY(10, TS(component1, *, metrics1))
```

Multiply Operator. Has same conditions as division operator. This is to keep the API simple.
Accepts two arguments, both can be univariate or multivariate. Each can be of one of the following types:

1. Numeric constant will be considered as a constant time series for all applicable timestamps, they will not fill the missing values
2. Operator - returns one or more timelines

Three main cases are:

1. When both operands are multivariate
    1. Multiply operation will be done on matching data, that is, with same instance id.
    2. If the instances in both the operands do not match, error is thrown.
    3. Returns multivariate time series, each representing the result of multiplication
        on the two corresponding time series.
2. When one operand is univariate, and other is multivariate

Returns univariate or multivariate time series based on the argument, with each timestamp value
corresponding to the rate of change for that timestamp.
