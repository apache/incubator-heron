title: Managing Topologies with Heron CLI
---

The **Heron CLI** us used to to manage every aspect of the
[topology lifecycle](../../concepts/topologies#topology-lifecycle).

## Deploying the `heron` CLI Executable

To use `heron` CLI, download the `heron-client-install` for your platfrom from
[release binaries](https://github.com/twitter/heron/releases) and  run the
installation script. For example, if you have downloaded the version `0.13.5`,
you invoke the installation script as follows:

```bash
$ chmod +x heron-client-install-0.13.5-darwin.sh
$ ./heron-client-install-0.13.5-darwin.sh --user
Heron client installer
----------------------

Uncompressing......

Heron is now installed!

Make sure you have "/Users/$USER/bin" in your path.

See http://heronstreaming.io/docs/getting-started.html on how to use Heron!

....
```

Alternatively, generate a full [Heron release](../../developers/compiling/compiling) and
distribute the resulting `heron` CLI to all machines used to manage topologies.

### Common CLI Args

All topology management commands (`submit`, `activate`, `deactivate`,
`restart`, `update` and `kill`) take the following required arguments:

* `cluster` --- The name of the cluster where the command needs to be executed.

* `role` --- This represents the user or the group depending on deployment.
  If not provided, it defaults to the unix user.

* `env` --- This is a tag for including additional information (e.g) a
   topology can be tagged as PROD or DEVEL to indicate whether it is in production
   or development. If `env` is not provided, it is given a value `default`

`cluster`, `role` and `env` are specified as a single argument in the form of
`cluster/role/env` (e.g) `local/ads/PROD` to refer the cluster `local` with
role `ads` and the environment `PROD`. If you just want to specify `cluster`, the
argument will be simply `local`.

### Optional CLI Flags

CLI supports a common set of optional flags for all topology management commands
(`submit`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `restart`, `update` and `kill`):

* `--config-path` --- Every heron cluster must provide a few configuration
  files that are kept under a directory named after the cluster. By default,
  when a cluster is provided in the command, it searches the `conf` directory
  for a directory with the cluster name. This flag enables you to specify a
  non standard directory to search for the cluster directory.

* `--config-property` --- Heron supports several configuration parameters
  that be overridden. These parameters are specified in the form of `key=value`.

* `--verbose` --- When this flag is provided, `heron` CLI prints logs
  that provide detailed information about the execution.

Below is an example topology management command that uses one of these flags:

```bash
$ heron activate --config-path ~/heronclusters devcluster/ads/PROD AckingTopology
```

## Submitting a Topology

To run a topology in a Heron cluster, submit it using the `submit` command.
Topologies can be submitted in either an activated (default) or deactivated state
(more on [activation](#activating-a-topology) and [deactivation](#deactivating-a-topology)
below).

Below is the basic syntax:

```bash
$ heron help submit
usage: heron submit [options] cluster/[role]/[env] topology-file-name topology-class-name [topology-args]

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and env to run topology
  topology-file-name    Topology jar/tar/zip file
  topology-class-name   Topology class name

Optional arguments:
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "/Users/$USER/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
  --deploy-deactivated (a boolean; default: "false")
  --topology-main-jvm-property Define a system property to pass to java -D when running main.
  --verbose (a boolean; default: "false")
```

Arguments of the `submit` command:

* **cluster/[role]/[env]** --- The cluster where topology needs to be submitted,
  optionally taking the role and environment. For example,`local/ads/PROD` or just `local`

* **topology-file-name** --- The path of the file in which you've packaged the
  topology's code. For Java topologies this will be a `.jar` file; for
  topologies in other languages (not yet supported), this could be a
  `.tar` file. For example, `/path/to/topology/my-topology.jar`

* **topology-class-name** --- The name of the class containing the `main` function
  for the topology. For example, `com.example.topologies.MyTopology`

* **topology-args** (optional) --- Arguments specific to the topology.
  You will need to supply additional args only if the `main` function for your
  topology requires them.

### Example Topology Submission Command

Below is an example command that submits a topology to a cluster named `devcluster`
with a main class named `com.example.topologies.MyTopology` packaged in `my-topology.jar`,
along with the optional `--config-path` where the config for `devcluster` can be found:

```bash
$ heron submit --config-path ~/heronclusters devcluster /path/to/topology/my-topology.jar \
    com.example.topologies.MyTopology my-topology
```

### Other Topology Submission Options

| Flag                           | Meaning                                                                 |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--deploy-deactivated`         | If set, the topology is deployed in a deactivated state.                |
| `--topology-main-jvm-property` | Defines a system property to pass to java -D when running topology main |


## Activating a Topology

Topologies are submitted to the cluster in the activated state by default. To
activate a deactivated topology use the `activate` command. Below is the basic
syntax:

```bash
$ heron help activate
usage: heron activate [options] cluster/[role]/[env] topology-name

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and env to run topology
  topology-name         Name of the topology

Optional arguments:
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "/Users/$USER/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
```

Arguments of the `activate` command:

* **cluster/[role]/[env]** --- The cluster where topology needs to be submitted,
  optionally taking the role and environment. For exampple, `local/ads/PROD` or just `local`

* **topology-name**  --- The name of the already-submitted topology that you'd
  like to activate.

### Example Topology Activation Command

```bash
$ heron activate local/ads/PROD my-topology
```

## Deactivating a Topology

You can deactivate a running topology at any time using the `deactivate`
command. Here's the basic syntax:

```bash
$ heron help deactivate
usage: heron deactivate [options] cluster/[role]/[env] topology-name

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and env to run topology
  topology-name         Name of the topology

Optional arguments:
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "/Users/kramasamy/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
  --verbose (a boolean; default: "false")

```

Arguments of the `deactivate` command:

* **cluster/[role]/[env]** --- The cluster where topology needs to be submitted,
  optionally taking the role and environment. For example, `local/ads/PROD` or just `local`

* **topology-name** --- The name of the topology that you'd like to deactivate.

## Restarting a Topology

You can restart a deactivated topology using the `restart` command (assuming
that the topology has not yet been killed, i.e. removed from the cluster).

```bash
$ heron help restart
usage: heron restart [options] cluster/[role]/[env] topology-name [container-id]

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and env to run topology
  topology-name         Name of the topology
  container-id          Identifier of the container to be restarted

Optional arguments:
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "/Users/kramasamy/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
  --verbose (a boolean; default: "false")
```

Arguments of the `restart` command:

* **cluster/[role]/[env]** --- The cluster where topology needs to be submitted,
  optionally taking the role and environment. For example, `local/ads/PROD` or just `local`

* **topology-name** --- The name of the topology that you'd like to restart.

* **container-id** (optional) --- This enables you to specify the container ID to be
  restarted if you want to restart only a specific container of the topology.

### Example Topology Restart Command

```bash
$ heron restart local/ads/PROD my-topology
```

## Updating a Topology

You can update the parallelism of any of the components of a deployed
topology using the `update` command.

```bash
$ heron help update
usage: heron update [options] cluster/[role]/[env] <topology-name> --component-parallelism <name:value>

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and environment to run topology
  topology-name         Name of the topology

Optional arguments:
  --component-parallelism COMPONENT_PARALLELISM
                        Component name and the new parallelism value colon-
                        delimited: [component_name]:[parallelism]
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "/Users/billg/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
  --verbose (a boolean; default: "false")
```

Arguments of the `update` command include **cluster/[role]/[env]** and
**topology-name** as well as:

* **--component-parallelism** --- This argument can be included multiple
times to change the parallelism of components in the deployed topology.

### Example Topology Update Command

```bash
$ heron update local/ads/PROD my-topology \
  --component-parallelism=my-spout:2 \
  --component-parallelism=my-bolt:4
```

## Killing a Topology

If you've submitted a topology to your Heron cluster and would like to remove
knowledge of the topology entirely, you can remove it using the `kill` command.
Here's the basic syntax:

```bash
$ heron kill <killer-overrides> <topology>
```

Arguments of the `kill` command:

* **cluster/[role]/[env]** --- The cluster where topology needs to be submitted,
  optionally taking the role and environment.  For example, `local/ads/PROD` or just
  `local`

* **topology-name** --- The name of the topology that you'd like to kill.

### Example Topology Kill Command

```bash
$ heron kill local my-topology
```

## Heron CLI configuration

When using the Heron CLI tool to interact with Heron clusters, there are two ways to provide configuration for the tool:

* Via command-line flags, such as `--service-url`
* Using the `heron config` interface, which enables you to set, unset, and list configs in the local filesystem

### Available parameters

The following parameters can currently be set using the `heron config` interface:

Parameter | Description | Corresponding CLI flag
:---------|:------------|:----------------------
`service_url` | The service URL for the Heron cluster | `--service-url`

### Set configuration

You can set a config using the `set` command. Here's an example:

```bash
$ heron config us-west-staging set service_url http://us-west.staging.example.com:9000
```

### Unset configuration

You can remove a parameter using the `unset` command. Here's an example:

```bash
$ heron config apac-australia unset service_url
```

### List configuration

You can list all of the CLI configs for a Heron cluster using the `list` command. This will return the configs as a list of `parameter = value` pairs. Here's an example:

```bash
$ heron config local list
service_url = http://localhost:9000
```

### Configuration example

Let's say that you need to interact with a Heron cluster called `apac-japan-staging` which has a service
URL of http://apac-japan.staging.example.com:9000. If you specified the service URL via CLI flags, you'd need
to set the flag every time you perform an operation involving that cluster:

```bash
$ heron deactivate apac-japan-staging MyTopology \
  --service-url http://apac-japan.staging.example.com:9000
```

Using `heron config`, however, you could set the service URL for that cluster once and for all:

```bash
$ heron config apac-japan-staging set service_url http://apac-japan.staging.example.com:9000
$ heron deactivate apac-japan-staging MyTopology
```

## Other Commands

### Version

Run the `version` command at any time to see which version of `heron` you're
using:

```bash
$ heron version
heron.build.version : 0.13.5
heron.build.time : Wed May 11 23:49:00 PDT 2016
heron.build.timestamp : 1463035740000
heron.build.host : mbp-machine
heron.build.user : userwhobuilt
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.000s.
