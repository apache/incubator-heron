title: Heron Explorer
---

The **Heron Explorer** is a CLI tool that you can use to gain insight into a Heron installation, including:

* which clusters are currently running in the installation
* information about a given topology's components (spouts and bolts)
* metrics for a topology
* the containers in which a topology is running
* the topologies running in a given cluster, role, or environment

> #### The Heron Explorer vs. Heron CLI
> There are two important differences between the Heron Explorer and [Heron CLI](../heron-cli). Unlike Heron CLI, the Heron Explorer (a) requires the [Heron Tracker](../heron-tracker) and (b) performs read-only, observation-oriented commands (rather than commands for actions like submitting, activating, and killing topologies).

In order to use the Heron Explorer, the [Heron Tracker](../heron-tracker) will need to be running. If you've [installed the Tracker](../../getting-started), you can start it up using just one command:

```shell
$ heron-tracker
```

## Installation

The Heron Explorer is installed automatically if you follow the Heron tools installation tutorial in the [Quick Start Guide](../../getting-started#step-1-download-the-heron-tools).

## Commands

The commands available for the Heron Explorer are listed in the table below.

Command | Action | Arguments
:-------|:-------|:---------
[`clusters`](#clusters) | Lists all currently available Heron clusters | None
[`components`](#components) | Displays information about a topology's spout and bolt components, including each component's inputs and outputs (if any) and parallelism | `[cluster]/[role]/[env] [topology-name] [options]`
[`metrics`](#metrics) | Displays metrics for a topology | `[cluster]/[role]/[env] [topology-name] [options]`
[`containers`](#containers) | Displays all of the containers in which a topology is running | `[cluster]/[role]/[env] [topology-name] [options]`
[`topologies`](#topologies) | Displays all topologies currently running in the specified cluster, cluster/role, or cluster/role/env | `[cluster]/[role]/[env] [topology-name] [options]`


In addition to these commands, you can get help output by running `heron-explorer help` and the current version of Heron Explorer by running `heron-explorer version`.

## Cluster, role, and environment

To use a topology about which you'd like to gather information using Heron Explorer, you need to supply one of the following:

* the cluster name
* the cluster name and role
* the cluster name, role, and environment

Here are three examples corresponding to the options above:

```bash
$ heron-explorer topologies local
$ heron-explorer topologies us-west/finance
$ heron-explorer topologies asia-1/iot/devel
```

## Clusters

The `clusters` command lists all of the clusters running in the Heron installation. It takes no arguments.

Here's an example command and output:

```bash
$ heron-explorer clusters
Available clusters:
  local
```

## Components

The `components` command lists information about all of a topology's components (spouts and bolts), including:

* the type of the component (either `spout` or `bolt`)
* the name of the component
* the parallelism hint for the component
* the inputs and outputs for the component

Here's an example command and output:

```bash
$ heron-explorer components \
  us-east/analytics/staging \
  ClickCounterTopology
type    name             parallelism  input                  output
------  -------------  -------------  ---------------------  -------------
spout   click-ingest               2  -                      click-counter
bolt    click-counter              2 - click-ingest          persist-to-db
```

## Metrics

The `metrics` command lists a wide variety of metrics about each component in a topology:

* the container in which the component is running
* the JVM uptime for the component (in seconds)
* the JVM process CPU load for the component (as a %)
* the total JVM memory used by the component (in megabytes)
* the component's emit, ack, and fail counts

Here's an example command:

```bash
$ heron-explorer metrics \
  us-east/analytics/staging \
  ClickCounterTopology
```

And here's some example output:

```bash
'click-ingest' metrics:
container id                   jvm-uptime-secs    jvm-process-cpu-load    jvm-memory-used-mb    emit-count    ack-count    fail-count
--------------------------   -----------------  ----------------------  --------------------  ------------  -----------  ------------
container_1_click-ingest_1             1012                   0.510003                    83   2.81582e+07            0             0
container_2_click-ingest_2             1012                      0.467                    71   2.34582e+07            0             0

'click-counter' metrics:
container id                    jvm-uptime-secs    jvm-process-cpu-load    jvm-memory-used-mb    emit-count    ack-count    fail-count
----------------------------  -----------------  ----------------------  --------------------  ------------  -----------  ------------
container_1_click-counter_1                1012                  0.5201                    83   2.81432e+07            0             0
container_2_click-counter_2                1012                   0.481                    71   2.14896e+07            0             0
```

## Containers

The `containers` command lists all of the containers in which a topology is running, and provides the following information about each container:

* The ID of the container
* The host on which the container is running as well as the port it's using
* A process ID (pid) for the container
* The number of bolts, spouts, and total component instances

Here's an example command:

```bash
$ heron-explorer containers \
  us-east/analytics/staging \
  ClickCounterTopology
```

And here's some example output:

```bash
  container  host                  port    pid    #bolt    #spout    #instance
-----------  -----------------   ------  -----  -------  --------  -----------
          1  us-west.1.acme.com   62915  47893        1         1            1
          2  us-west.2.acme.com   62147  14390        1         1            1
```

## Topologies

The `topologies` command lists all topologies for one of the following:

* cluster
* cluster and role
* cluster, role, and environment

Here's an example command and output:

```bash
$ heron-explorer \
  us-east/analytics/staging
Topologies running in cluster 'us-east/analytics/staging'
role       env      topology
---------  -------  -------------------------
analytics  staging  ClickCounterTopology
```
