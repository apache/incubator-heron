title: Observability with Prometheus
---

You can integrate Heron with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to monitor and gather runtime metrics exported by Heron topologies.

## Exporting topology metrics from Heron to Prometheus

Heron supports custom metric exporters from the Metrics Manager. You can either build your own Prometheus metrics sink or use the [provided Prometheus sink](/docs/contributors/custom-metrics-sink/).

To set up your Heron cluster to export to Prometheus, you need to make two changes to the `metrics_sinks.yaml` configuration file:

* Add `prometheus-sink` to the `sinks` list
* Add a `prometheus-sink` map to the file that sets values for the [parameters](#prometheus-parameters) listed below. You can uncomment the existing `prometheus-sink` map to get the default configuration.

### Prometheus parameters

Parameter | Description | Default
:---------|:------------|:-------
`class` | The Java class used to control Prometheus sink behavior | [`org.apache.heron.metricsmgr.sink.PrometheusSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/metricsmgr/sink/PrometheusSink.html)
`port` | The port on which Prometheus will scrape for metrics. **Note**: You must supply a `port` *or* `port-file` config. | 8080
`port-file` | The path to a text file that contains the port number to be used by Prometheus for metrics scraping. **Note**: You must supply a `port` *or* `port-file` config. | `metrics.port`
`path` | The Prometheus path on which to publish metrics | `/metrics`
`include-topology-name` | Whether the name of the Heron topology will be included in names for metrics | `true`
`metrics-cache-max-size` | The maximum number of metrics cached and published | 1000000
`metrics-cache-ttl-sec` | The time to live (TTL) for metrics, i.e. the time, in seconds after which a metric that was collected will stop being published | 600 (10 minutes)
