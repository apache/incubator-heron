title: Heron's Data Model
---

The [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) is Heron's core data type. All
data that is fed into a Heron topology via [spouts](spouts.html) and then
processed by [bolts](bolts.html) consists of tuples.

Heron has a special
[`Tuple`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html) interface for
working with tuples. Heron `Tuple`s can hold values of any type; values are
accessible either by providing an index or a field name.

## Using Tuples

Heron's `Tuple` interface contains the methods listed in the [Javadoc
definition](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html).

### Accessing Primitive Types By Index

Heron `Tuple`s support a wide variety of primitive Java types, including
strings, Booleans, byte arrays, and more.
[`getString`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html#getString-int-)
method, for example, takes an integer index and returns either a string or
`null` if no string value is present at that index. Analogous methods can be
found in the Javadoc.

### Accessing Primitive Types By Field

In addition to being accessible via index, values stored in Heron tuples are
accessible via field name as well. The
[`getStringByField`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html#getStringByField-java.lang.String-)
method, for example, takes a field name string and returns either a string or
`null` if no string value is present for that field name. Analogous methods can
be found in the Javadoc.

### Using Non-primitive Types

In addition to primitive types, you can access any value in a Heron `Tuple` as a
Java `Object`. As for primitive types, you can access `Object`s on the basis of
an index or a field name. The following methods return either an `Object` or
`null` if no object is present:

* [`getValue`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html#getValue-int-)
* [`getValueByField`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html#getValueByField-java.lang.String-)

You can also retrieve all objects contained in a Heron `Tuple` as a Java
[List](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) using the
[`getValues`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html#getValues--)
method.

### User-defined Types

You use Heron tuples in conjunction with more complex, user-defined types using
[type casting](http://www.studytonight.com/java/type-casting-in-java), provided
that you've created and registered a [custom serializer](serialization.html) for the type.
Here's an example (which assumes that a serializer for the type
`Tweet` has been created and registered):

```java
public void execute(Tuple input) {
    // The following return null if no value is present or throws a
    // ClassCastException if type casting fails:
    Tweet tweet = (Tweet) input.getValue(0);
    List<Tweet> allTweets = input.getValues();
}
```

More info on custom serialization can be found in [Creating Custom Tuple
Serializers](serialization.html).

### Fields

The `getFields` method returns a
[`Fields`](http://heronproject.github.io/topology-api/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Fields)
object that contains all of the fields in the tuple. More on fields can be found
[below](#fields).

### Other Methods

There are additional methods available for determining the size of Heron
`Tuple`s, extracting contextual information, and more. For a full listing of
methods, see the
[Javadoc](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Tuple.html).

## Fields

From the methods in the list above you can see that you can retrieve single
values from a Heron tuple on the basis of their index. You can also retrieve
multiple values using a
[`Fields`](../api/topology/com/twitter/heron/api/tuple/Fields.html) object,
which can be initialized either using varargs or a list of strings:

```java
// Using varargs
Fields fruits = new Fields("apple", "orange", "banana");

// Using a list of strings
List<String> fruitNames = new LinkedList<String>();
fruitNames.add("apple");
// Add "orange" and "banana" as well
Fields fruits = new Fields(fruitNames);
```

You can then use that object in conjunction with a tuple:

```java
public void execute(Tuple input) {
    List<Object> values = input.select(fruits);
    for (Object value : values) {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
```
