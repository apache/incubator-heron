title: Simulator Mode
---

Simulator mode is specifically designed for topology developers to easily debug or optimize their 
topologies.

Simulator mode simulates a heron cluster in a single JVM process, which is useful for developing and 
testing topologies. Running topologies under simulator mode is similar to running topologies on a 
cluster.

# Develop a topology using simulator mode

To run in simulator mode, use the ``SimulatorMode`` class, which is
in ``storm-compatibility-unshaded_deploy.jar``  (under ``bazel-bin/storm-compatibility/src/java``).

For example:

```java
import com.twitter.heron.simulator.Simulator;
Simulator simulator = new Simulator();
```

You can then submit topologies using the ``submitTopology`` method on the ``Simulator`` object. Just
like the corresponding method on ``StormSubmitter``, ``submitTopology`` takes a name, a topology 
configuration, and a topology object.

For example:

```java
simulator.submitTopology("test", conf, builder.createTopology());
```

Other lifecycle methods to use with simulator mode are:

```java
simulator.killTopology("test");
simulator.activate("test");
simulator.deactivate("test");
simulator.shutdown();
```

To kill a topology, one could also terminate the process.

The simulator mode will run in separate threads other than the main thread. All the above methods are 
thread-safe. This means that one could invoke these methods in other threads and monitor the 
corresponding behaviors interactively.

# Debug topology using IntelliJ

Bolts and Spouts run as separate threads in simulator. To add breakpoints inside a bolt/spout, the 
Suspend Policy of the breakpoint needs to be set to Thread. To change the Suspend Policy, right 
click on the breakpoint as shown in the following image:

If it's not convenient to check the output and logs in the IntelliJ console, save them to a local file 
by choosing `Run -> Edit Configurations....` as shown in the following image:
