title: Writing and Launching Topologies in Java
--- 

{{< alert "storm-api" >}}

A topology specifies components like [spouts](../spouts) and [bolts](../bolts), as well as the relation
between components and proper configurations. The
[`heron-api`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.twitter.heron%22%20AND%20a%3A%22heron-api%22)
enables you to create topology logic in Java.

> If you're interested in creating stateful topologies with [effectively-once
> semantics](../../../concepts/delivery-semantics) in Java, see [this new
> guide](../effectively-once).

## Getting started

In order to use the Heron API for Java, you'll need to install the `heron-api` library, which is available
via [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).

### Maven setup

To install the `heron-api` library using Maven, add this to the `dependencies` block of your `pom.xml`
configuration file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.twitter.heron</groupId>
    <artifactId>heron-api</artifactId>
    <version>{{< heronVersion >}}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Compiling a JAR with dependencies

In order to run a Java topology in a Heron cluster, you'll need to package your topology as a "fat" JAR with dependencies included. You can use the [Maven Assembly Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/usage.html) to generate JARs with dependencies. To install the plugin and add a Maven goal for a single JAR, add this to the `plugins` block in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <descriptorRefs>
            <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
        </descriptorRefs>
        <archive>
            <manifest>
                <mainClass></mainClass>
            </manifest>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>make-assembly</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>single</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Once your `pom.xml` is properly set up, you can compile the JAR with dependencies using this command:

```bash
$ mvn assembly:assembly
```

By default, this will add a JAR in your project's `target` folder with the name `PROJECT-NAME-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. Here's an example topology submission command using a compiled JAR:

```bash
$ mvn assembly:assembly
$ heron submit local \
  target/my-project-1.2.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
  com.example.Main \
  MyTopology arg1 arg2
```

### Writing your topology logic

Heron [topologies](../../../concepts/topologies) are processing graphs consisting
of [spouts](../spouts) that ingest data and [bolts](../bolts) that process that data.

{{< alert "spouts-and-bolts" >}}

Once you've defined the spouts and bolts, a topology can be composed using a
[`TopologyBuilder`](/api/com/twitter/heron/api/topology/TopologyBuilder.html). The
`TopologyBuilder` has two major methods used to specify topology components:

Method | Description
:------|:-----------
`setBolt(String id, IRichBolt bolt, Number parallelismHint)` | `id` is the unique identifier that assigned to a bolt, `bolt` is the one previously composed, and `parallelismHint` is a number that specifies the number of instances of this bolt.
`setSpout(String id, IRichSpout spout, Number parallelismHint)` | `id` is the unique identifier that assigned to a spout, `spout` is the one previously composed, and `parallelismHint` is a number that specifying the number of instances of this spout.

Here's a simple example:

```java

TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();
builder.setSpout("word", new TestWordSpout(), 5);
builder.setBolt("exclaim", new ExclamationBolt(), 4);
```

In addition to the component specification, you also need to specify how tuples
will be routed between your topology components. There are a few different grouping
strategies available:

Grouping strategy | Description
:-----------------|:-----------
Fields grouping | Tuples are transmitted to bolts based on a given field. Tuples with the same field will always go to the same bolt.
Global grouping | All tuples are transmitted to a single instance of a bolt with the lowest task id.
Shuffle Grouping | Tuples are randomly transmitted to different instances of a bolt.
None grouping | Currently, this is the same as shuffle grouping.
All grouping | All tuples are transmitted to all instances of a bolt.
Custom grouping | User-defined grouping strategy.

The following snippet is a simple example of specifying shuffle grouping
between a `word` spout and an `exclaim` bolt.

```java

builder.setBolt("exclaim", new ExclamationBolt(), 4)
  .shuffleGrouping("word");
```

Once the components and the grouping are specified, the topology can be built.

```java
HeronTopology topology = builder.createTopology();
```

See the [`ExclamationTopology`](https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/examples/src/java/com/twitter/heron/examples/ExclamationTopology.java) for the complete example. More examples can be found in the  [`examples package`](https://github.com/twitter/heron/tree/master/examples/src/java/com/twitter/heron/examples).

## Applying delivery semantics to topologies

```java
import com.twitter.heron.api.Config;

Config topologyConfig = new Config();

config.setTopologyReliabilityMode(Config.TopologyReliabilityMode.EFFECTIVELY_ONCE);
```

There are three delivery semantics available corresponding to the three delivery semantics that Heron provides:

* `ATMOST_ONCE`
* `ATLEAST_ONCE`
* `EFFECTIVELY_ONCE`
