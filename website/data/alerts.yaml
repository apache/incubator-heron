streamlet-api-beta:
  title: The Heron Streamlet API is in beta
  content: The Heron Streamlet API is well tested and can be used to build and test topologies locally. The API is not yet fully stable, however, and breaking changes are likely in the coming weeks.

storm-api:
  title: This document pertains to the older, Storm-based, Heron Topology API
  content: |
    Heron now offers two separate APIs for building topologies: the original, [Storm](https://storm.apache.org)-based Topology API, and the newer [Streamlet API](../../../concepts/topologies#the-heron-streamlet-api). Topologies created using the Topology API can still run on Heron and there are currently no plans to deprecate this API. We would, however, recommend that you use the Streamlet API for future work.

spouts-and-bolts:
  title: Don't want to manually create spouts and bolts? Try the Heron Streamlet API
  type: success
  content: |
    If you find manually creating and connecting spouts and bolts to be overly cumbersome, we recommend trying out the [Heron Streamlet API](../streamlet-api) for Java, which enables you to create your topology logic using a highly streamlined logic inspired by functional programming concepts.
heron-config:
  title: Heron cluster configuration versus topology configuration
  type: info
  content: |
    This guide shows you how to configure the various components of your Heron installation, including the state manager, the Heron API server, metrics sinks, and more.

    You can also provide configuration for the topologies that you run, which will not be covered here. Instead, see the guides to writing topologies in [Java](../../developers/java/streamlet-api) and [Python](../../developers/python/topologies) for more information.
