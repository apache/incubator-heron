  title: The Heron Functional API is in beta
  content: The Heron Functional API is well tested and can be used to build and test topologies locally. The API is not yet fully stable, however, and breaking changes are likely in the coming weeks.

storm-api:
  title: This document pertains to the older, Storm-based, Heron Topology API
  content: |
    Heron now offers two separate APIs for building topologies: the original, [Storm](https://storm.apache.org)-based Topology API, and the newer [Functional API](../../../concepts/topologies#the-heron-functional-api). Topologies created using the Topology API can still run on Heron and there are currently no plans to deprecate this API. We would, however, recommend that you use the Functional API for future work.
