  Topology writers need to inherit this ``Spout`` class to define their own custom spout, by
  implementing ``initialize()``, ``next_tuple()``, ``ack()`` and ``fail()`` methods.
  In addition, ``close()``, ``activate()`` and ``deactivate()`` are available to be implemented.

    used internally by Heron Instance; instead, you should use this method to initialize
    any custom instance variables or connections to data sources.
