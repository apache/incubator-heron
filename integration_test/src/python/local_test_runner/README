Integration test for testing various heron-cli and process failure scenarios. Runs a local-scheduler
heron topology. The test creates an input file of test data, which a spout emits. A bolt writes each
tuple to an output file and the two files are compared.

To run the tests:

  bazel run --config=darwin -- scripts/packages:heron-install.sh --user
  bazel build --config=darwin integration_test/src/...
  ./bazel-bin/integration_test/src/python/local_test_runner/local-test-runner
