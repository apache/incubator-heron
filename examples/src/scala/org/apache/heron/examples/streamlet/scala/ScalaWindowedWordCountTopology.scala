/**
  * This topology is an implementation of the classic word count example
  * for the Heron Streamlet API for Scala. A source streamlet emits an
  * indefinite series of sentences chosen at random from a pre-defined list.
  * Each sentence is then mapped to lower-case and "flattened" into a list of individual words. A
  * reduce function keeps a running tally of the number of times each word
  * is encountered within each time window (in this case a tumbling count
  * window of 50 operations). The result is then logged.
