> If you'd prefer to install Heron on Kubernetes *without* using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager, see the [Heron on Kubernetes by hand](schedulers-k8s-by-hand) document.

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is an open source package manager for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) that enables you to quickly and easily install even the most complex software systems on Kubernetes. Heron has a Helm [chart](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/#charts) that you can use to install Heron on Kubernetes using just a few commands. The chart can be used to install Heron on the following platforms:

* [Minikube](#minikube) (the default)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine](#google-kubernetes-engine)
* [Amazon Web Services](#amazon-web-services)
* [Bare metal](#bare-metal)

## Requirements

In order to install Heron on Kubernetes using Helm, you'll need to have an existing Kubernetes cluster on one of the supported [platforms](#specifying-a-platform) (which includes [bare metal](#bare-metal) installations).

## Installing the Helm client

In order to get started, you need to install Helm on your machine. Installation instructions for [macOS](#helm-for-macos) and [Linux](#helm-for-linux) are below.

### Helm for macOS

You can install Helm on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
$ brew install kubernetes-helm
```

### Helm for Linux

You can install Helm on Linux using a simple installation script:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > install-helm.sh
$ chmod 700 install-helm.sh
$ ./install-helm.sh
```

## Installing Helm in your Kubernetes cluster

To run Helm on Kubernetes, you need to first make sure that [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) is using the right configuration context for your cluster. To check which context is being used:

```bash
$ kubectl config current-context
```

If the context is correct, then you can get Helm running using just one command:

```bash
$ helm init
```

If the output of that command includes `Happy Helming!` then Helm is ready to go.

## Installing Heron on Kubernetes

Once you've installed the Helm client on your machine and gotten Helm running in your Kubernetes cluster, you need to make your client aware of the `heron-charts` Helm repository, which houses the chart for Heron:

```bash
$ helm repo add heron-charts https://storage.googleapis.com/heron-charts
"heron-charts" has been added to your repositories
```

Now you can install the Heron package:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron
```

This will install Heron and provide the installation with a random name like `jazzy-anaconda`. To provide the installation with a name, such as `heron-kubernetes`:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --name heron-kubernetes
```

### Specifying a platform

The default platform for running Heron on Kubernetes is [Minikube](#minikube). To specify a different platform, you can use the `--set platform=PLATFORM` flag. Here's an example:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=gke
```

The available platforms are:

Platform | Tag
:--------|:---
[Minikube](#minikube) | `minikube`
[Google Kubernetes Engine](#google-kubernetes-engine) | `gke`
[Amazon Web Services](#amazon-web-services) | `aws`
[Bare metal](#bare-metal) | `baremetal`

#### Minikube

To run Heron on Minikube, you need to first [install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/). Once Minikube is installed, you can start it by running `minikube start`. Please note, however, that Heron currently requires the following resources:

* 7 GB of memory
* 5 CPUs
* 20 GB of disk space

To start up Minikube with the minimum necessary resources:

```bash
$ minikube start \
  --memory=7168 \
  --cpus=5 \
  --disk-size=20g
```

Once Minikube is running, you can then install Heron in one of two ways:

```bash
# Use the Minikube default
$ helm install heron-charts/heron

# Explicitly select Minikube
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=minikube
```

#### Google Kubernetes Engine

The resources required to run Heron on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) vary based on your use case. To run a basic Heron cluster intended for development and experimentation, you'll need at least:

* 3 nodes
* [n1-standard-4](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#standard_machine_types) machines

To create a cluster with those resources using the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) tool:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters create heron-gke-dev-cluster \
  --num-nodes=3 \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-2
```

For a production-ready cluster you'll want a larger cluster with:

* *at least* 8 nodes
* [n1-standard-4 or n1-standard-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#standard_machine_types) machines (preferably the latter)

To create such a cluster:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters create heron-gke-prod-cluster \
  --num-nodes=8 \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-8
```

Once the cluster has been successfully created, you'll need to install that cluster's credentials locally so that they can be used by [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). You can do this in just one command:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials heron-gke-dev-cluster # or heron-gke-prod-cluster
```

Once, the cluster is running (that could take a few minutes), you can initialize Helm on the cluster:

```bash
$ helm init
```

Then, you'll need to adjust some RBAC permissions for your cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl create serviceaccount tiller \
  --namespace kube-system \
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --serviceaccount kube-system:tiller
$ kubectl patch deploy tiller-deploy \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'
```

Finally, you can install Heron:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=gke
```

##### Resource configurations

Helm enables you to supply sets of variables via YAML files. There are currently a handful of different resource configurations that can be applied to your Heron on GKE cluster upon installation:

Configuration | Description
:-------------|:-----------
[`small.yaml`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/gke/small.yaml) | Smaller Heron cluster intended for basic testing, development, and experimentation
[`medium.yaml`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/gke/medium.yaml) | Closer geared for production usage

To apply the `small` configuration, for example:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=gke \
  --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-heron/master/deploy/kubernetes/gcp/small.yaml
```

#### Amazon Web Services

To run Heron on Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you'll need to 

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=aws
```

##### Using S3 uploader

You can make Heron to use S3 to distribute the user topologies. First you need to set up a S3 bucket and configure an IAM user with enough permissions over it. Get access keys for the user. Then you can deploy Heron like this:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=aws \
  --set uploader.class=s3 \
  --set uploader.s3Bucket=heron \
  --set uploader.s3PathPrefix=topologies \
  --set uploader.s3AccessKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
  --set uploader.s3SecretKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
  --set uploader.s3Region=us-west-1
```

#### Bare metal

To run Heron on a bare metal Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
$ helm install heron-charts/heron \
  --set platform=baremetal
```

### Managing topologies

> When setting the `heron` CLI configuration, make sure that the cluster name matches the name of the Helm installation. This can be either the name auto-generated by Helm or the name you supplied via the `--name` flag upon installation (in some of the examples above, the `heron-kubernetes` name was used). Make sure to adjust the name accordingly if necessary.

Once all of the components have been successfully started up, you need to open up a proxy port to your Kubernetes cluster using the [`kubectl proxy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/http-proxy-access-api/) command:

```bash
$ kubectl proxy -p 8001
```
> Note: All of the following Kubernetes specific urls are valid with the Kubernetes 1.10.0 release.
 
Now, verify that the Heron API server running on Minikube is available using curl:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/heron-kubernetes-apiserver:9000/proxy/api/v1/version
```


You should get a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "heron.build.git.revision" : "ddbb98bbf173fb082c6fd575caaa35205abe34df",
  "heron.build.git.status" : "Clean",
  "heron.build.host" : "ci-server-01",
  "heron.build.time" : "Sat Mar 31 09:27:19 UTC 2018",
  "heron.build.timestamp" : "1522488439000",
  "heron.build.user" : "release-agent",
  "heron.build.version" : "0.17.8"
}
```

## Running topologies on Heron on Kubernetes

Once you have a Heron cluster up and running on Kubernetes via Helm, you can use the [`heron` CLI tool](user-manuals-heron-cli) like normal if you set the proper URL for the [Heron API server](deployment-api-server). When running Heron on Kubernetes, that URL is:

```bash
$ http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/heron-kubernetes-apiserver:9000/proxy
```

To set that URL:

```bash
$ heron config heron-kubernetes set service_url \
  http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/heron-kubernetes-apiserver:9000/proxy
```

To test your cluster, you can submit an example topology:

```bash
$ heron submit heron-kubernetes \
  ~/.heron/examples/heron-streamlet-examples.jar \
  org.apache.heron.examples.streamlet.WindowedWordCountTopology \
  WindowedWordCount
```
