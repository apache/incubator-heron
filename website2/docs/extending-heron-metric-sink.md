title: Implementing a Custom Metrics Sink
sidebar_label: Custom Metrics Sink
---

Each Heron container has its own centralized [Metrics
Manager](heron-architecture#metrics-manager) (MM), which collects
metrics from all [Heron Instances](heron-architecture#heron-instance) in
the container. You can define how the MM processes metrics by implementing a
**metrics sink**, which specifies how the MM handles incoming
[`MetricsRecord`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/metrics/MetricsRecord.html)
objects.

> Java is currently the only supported language for custom metrics sinks. This may change in the future.

## Currently supported Sinks

Heron comes equipped out of the box with three metrics sinks that you can apply
for a specific topology. The code for these sinks may prove helpful for
implementing your own.

Sink | How it works
:----|:------------
[Prometheus](observability-prometheus) | [`PrometheusSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/metricsmgr/sink/PrometheusSink.html) sends each `MetricsRecord` object to a specified path in the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) instance.
[Graphite](observability-graphite) | [`GraphiteSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/metricsmgr/sink/GraphiteSink.html) sends each `MetricsRecord` object to a [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) instance according to a Graphite prefix.
[Scribe](observability-scribe) | [`ScribeSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/metricsmgr/sink/ScribeSink.html) sends each `MetricsRecord` object to a [Scribe](https://github.com/facebookarchive/scribe) instance according to a Scribe category and namespace.
Local filesystem | [`FileSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/metricsmgr/sink/FileSink.html) writes each `MetricsRecord` object to a JSON file at a specified path.

## Java Setup

In order to create a custom metrics sink, you need to import the `heron-spi`
library into your project.

#### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.heron</groupId>
  <artifactId>heron-spi</artifactId>
  <version>{{% heronVersion %}}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile group: "org.apache.heron", name: "heron-spi", version: "{{% heronVersion %}}"
}
```

## The `IMetricsSink` Interface

Each metrics sink must implement the
[`IMetricsSink`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/IMetricsSink.html)
interface, which requires you to implement the following methods:

Method | Description
:------|:-----------
[`init`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/IMetricsSink.html#init-java.util.Map-org.apache.heron.spi.metricsmgr.sink.SinkContext-) | Defines the initialization behavior of the sink. The `conf` map is the configuration that is passed to the sink by the `.yaml` configuration file at `heron/config/metrics_sink.yaml`; the [`SinkContext`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/SinkContext.html) object enables you to access values from the sink's runtime context (the ID of the metrics manager, the ID of the sink, and the name of the topology).
[`processRecord`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/IMetricsSink.html#processRecord-org.apache.heron.spi.metricsmgr.metrics.MetricsRecord-) | Defines how each [`MetricsRecord`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/metrics/MetricsRecord.html) that passes through the sink is processed.
[`flush`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/IMetricsSink.html#flush--) | Flush any buffered metrics; this function is called at the interval specified by the `flush-frequency-ms` parameter. More info can be found in the [Stream Manager](../../concepts/architecture#stream-manager) documentation.
[`close`](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/metricsmgr/sink/IMetricsSink.html#close--) | Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it; if the stream is already closed, invoking `close()` has no effect.

Your implementation of those interfaces will need to be packaged into a JAR file
and distributed to the `heron-core/lib/metricsmgr` folder of your [Heron
release](compiling-overview).

## Example Implementation

Below is an example implementation that simply prints the contents of each
metrics record as it passes through:

```java
import org.apache.heron.metricsmgr.api.metrics.MetricsInfo;
import org.apache.heron.metricsmgr.api.metrics.MetricsRecord;
import org.apache.heron.metricsmgr.api.sink.IMetricsSink;
import org.apache.heron.metricsmgr.api.sink.SinkContext;

public class PrintSink implements IMetricsSink {
    @Override
    public void init(Map<String, Object> conf, SinkContext context) {
        System.out.println("Sink configuration:");
        // This will print out each config in the supplied configuration
        for (Map.Entry<String, Object> config : conf.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(String.format("%s: %s", config.getKey(), config.getValue());
        }
        System.out.println(String.format("Topology name: %s", context.getTopologyName());
        System.out.println(String.format("Sink ID: %s", context.getSinkId()));
    }

    @Override
    public void processRecord(MetricsRecord record) {
        String recordString = String.format("Record received: %s", record.toString());
        System.out.println(recordString);
    }

    @Override
    public void flush() {
        // Since we're just printing to stdout in this sink, we don't need to
        // specify any flush() behavior
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        // Since we're just printing to stdout in this sink, we don't need to
        // specify any close() behavior
    }
}
```

## Configuring Your Custom Sink

The configuration for your sink needs to be provided in the
`metrics_sinks.yaml` configuration file in your scheduler's base configuration template.

At the top of that file there's a `sinks` parameter that lists each available
sink by name. You should add the sink you want to use to that list. Here's an example:

```yaml
sinks:
  - file-sink
  - scribe-sink
  - tmaster-sink
  - print-sink
  - prometheus-sink
```

For each sink you are required to specify the following:

Parameter | Description
:---------|:-----------
`class` | The Java class name of your custom implementation of the `IMetricsSink` interface, e.g. `biz.acme.heron.metrics.PrintSink`.
`flush-frequency-ms` | The frequency (in milliseconds) at which the `flush()` method is called in your implementation of `IMetricsSink`.
`sink-restart-attempts` | The number of times that a sink will attempt to restart if it throws exceptions and dies. If you do not set this, the default is 0; if you set it to -1, the sink will attempt to restart forever.

Here is an example `metrics_sinks.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
sinks:
  - custom-sink

print-sink:
  class: "biz.acme.heron.metrics.CustomSink"
  flush-frequency-ms: 60000 # One minute
  sink-restart-attempts: -1 # Attempt to restart forever
  some-other-config: false
```

It is optional to add other configurations for the sink. All configurations will be constructed
as an unmodifiable map `Map<String, Object> conf` and passed to the sink via the `init` function.

## Using Your Custom Sink

Once you've made a JAR for your custom Java sink, distributed that JAR to
`heron-core/lib/metricsmgr` folder, and changed the configuration in
`metrics_sinks.yaml` file in the base configuration template, any topology submitted using that configuration will include the custom sink.

You must [re-compile
Heron](compiling-overview) if you want to include the configuration in a new distribution of [Heron CLI](user-manuals-heron-cli).
