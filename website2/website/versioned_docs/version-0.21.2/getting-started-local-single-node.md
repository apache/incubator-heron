> The current version of Heron is {{heron:version}}

The easiest way to get started learning Heron is to install the Heron client tools, which are currently available for:

* [MacOS](#macos-homebrew)
* [Ubuntu >= 14.04](#using-installation-scripts)
* [CentOS](#using-installation-scripts)


For other platforms, you need to build from source. Please refer to the [guide to compiling Heron](compiling-overview).

## Step 1 --- Download the Heron tools

Heron tools can be installed on [macOS](#macos-homebrew) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and on Linux using [installation scripts](#using-installation-scripts).

> You can install using [installation scripts](#using-installation-scripts) on macOS as well.

## macOS/Homebrew

The easiest way to get started with Heron on macOS is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
$ brew tap streamlio/homebrew-formulae
$ brew update
$ brew install heron
```

This will install a variety of executables and other resources by default in `/usr/local/opt/heron`.

> Homebrew may use a different folder than `/usr/local/opt/heron`. To check which folder is being used, run `brew --prefix heron`.

## Using installation scripts

To install Heron binaries directly, using installation scripts, go to Heron's [releases page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/releases) on GitHub
and see a full listing of Heron releases for each available platform. The installation script for macOS (`darwin`), for example, is named
`heron-install-{{% heronVersion %}}-darwin.sh`.

Download the for your platform either from the releases page or using [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). Here's a `wget` example for Ubuntu:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/releases/download/{{% heronVersion %}}/heron-install-{{% heronVersion %}}-ubuntu.sh
```

Once you've downloaded the script, make it executable using [chmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod):

```bash
$ chmod +x heron-*.sh
```

> The script will install executables in the `~/bin` folder. You should add that folder to your `PATH` using `export PATH=~/bin:$PATH`.

Now run the [Heron client](user-manuals-heron-cli) installation script with the `--user` flag set. Here's an example for Ubuntu:

```bash
$ ./heron-install-{{% heronVersion %}}-ubuntu.sh --user
Heron installer
---------------

Uncompressing...done
...
Heron is now installed!
```

To check that Heron is successfully installed, run `heron version`:

```bash
$ heron version
heron.build.git.revision : 26bb4096130a05f9799510bbce6c37a69a7342ef
heron.build.git.status : Clean
heron.build.host : ...
heron.build.time : Sat Aug  6 12:35:47 PDT {{% currentYear %}}
heron.build.timestamp : 1470512147000
heron.build.user : ...
heron.build.version : {{% heronVersion %}}
```

## Step 2 --- Launch an example topology

> #### Note for macOS users

> If you want to run topologies locally on macOS, you may need to add your
> hostname to your `/etc/hosts` file under `localhost`. Here's an example line:
> `127.0.0.1 localhost My-Mac-Laptop.local`. You can fetch your hostname by simply
> running `hostname` in your shell.

If you set the `--user` flag when running the installation scripts, some example
topologies will be installed in your `~/.heron/examples` directory. You can
launch an example [topology](heron-topology-concepts) locally (on your machine)
using the [Heron CLI tool](user-manuals-heron-cli):

```bash
$ heron submit local \
  ~/.heron/examples/heron-streamlet-examples.jar \
  org.apache.heron.examples.streamlet.WindowedWordCountTopology \
  WindowedWordCountTopology \
  --deploy-deactivated
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
INFO: Launching topology 'WindowedWordCountTopology'

...

INFO: Topology 'WindowedWordCountTopology' launched successfully
INFO: Elapsed time: 3.409s.
```

This will *submit* the topology to your locally running Heron cluster but it
won't *activate* the topology because the `--deploy-deactivated` flag was set.
Activating the topology will be explored in [step
5](#step-5-explore-topology-management-commands) below.

Note that the output shows whether the topology has been launched successfully as well
the working directory for the topology.

To check what's under the working directory, run:

```bash
$ ls -al ~/.herondata/topologies/local/${ROLE}/WindowedWordCountTopology
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff     6141 Oct 12 09:58 WindowedWordCountTopology.defn
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff        5 Oct 12 09:58 container_1_flatmap1_4.pid
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff        5 Oct 12 09:58 container_1_logger1_3.pid
# etc.
```

All instances' log files can be found in `log-files` under the working directory:

```bash
$ ls -al ~/.herondata/topologies/local/${ROLE}/WindowedWordCountTopology/log-files
total 408
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff   5055 Oct 12 09:58 container_1_flatmap1_4.log.0
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff      0 Oct 12 09:58 container_1_flatmap1_4.log.0.lck
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff   5052 Oct 12 09:58 container_1_logger1_3.log.0
# etc.
```

## Step 3 --- Start Heron Tracker

The [Heron Tracker](user-manuals-heron-tracker-runbook) is a web service that
continuously gathers information about your Heron cluster. You can launch the
tracker by running the `heron-tracker` command (which is already installed):

```bash
$ heron-tracker
... Running on port: 8888
... Using config file: $HOME/.herontools/conf/heron_tracker.yaml
```

You can reach Heron Tracker in your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
and see something like the following upon successful submission of the topology:
![Heron Tracker](assets/heron-tracker.png)

To explore Heron Tracker, please refer to [Heron Tracker Rest API](user-manuals-tracker-rest)

## Step 4 --- Start Heron UI

[Heron UI](user-manuals-heron-ui-runbook) is a user interface that uses Heron Tracker to
provide detailed visual representations of your Heron topologies. To launch
Heron UI:

```bash
$ heron-ui
... Running on port: 8889
... Using tracker url: http://localhost:8888
```

You can open Heron UI in your browser at [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889)
and see something like this upon successful submission of the topology:
![Heron UI](assets/heron-ui.png)

To play with Heron UI, please refer to [Heron UI Usage Guide](guides-ui-guide)

## Step 5 --- Explore topology management commands

In step 2 you submitted a topology to your local cluster. The `heron` CLI tool
also enables you to activate, deactivate, and kill topologies and more.

```bash
$ heron activate local WindowedWordCountTopology
$ heron deactivate local WindowedWordCountTopology
$ heron kill local WindowedWordCountTopology
```

Upon successful actions, a message similar to the following will appear:

```bash
INFO: Successfully activated topology 'WindowedWordCountTopology'
INFO: Elapsed time: 1.980s.
```

For more info on these commands, read about [topology
lifecycles](heron-topology-concepts#topology-lifecycle).

To list the available CLI commands, run `heron` by itself:

```bash
usage: heron <command> <options> ...

Available commands:
    activate           Activate a topology
    deactivate         Deactivate a topology
    help               Prints help for commands
    kill               Kill a topology
    restart            Restart a topology
    submit             Submit a topology
    version            Print version of heron-cli

For detailed documentation, go to http://heronstreaming.io
```

To invoke help output for a command, run `heron help COMMAND`. Here's an
example:

```bash
$ heron help submit
usage: heron submit [options] cluster/[role]/[environ] topology-file-name topology-class-name [topology-args]

Required arguments:
  cluster/[role]/[env]  Cluster, role, and environ to run topology
  topology-file-name    Topology jar/tar/zip file
  topology-class-name   Topology class name

Optional arguments:
  --config-path (a string; path to cluster config; default: "$HOME/.heron/conf")
  --config-property (key=value; a config key and its value; default: [])
  --deploy-deactivated (a boolean; default: "false")
  -D DEFINE             Define a system property to pass to java -D when
                        running main.
  --verbose (a boolean; default: "false")
```

## Step 6 --- Explore other example topologies

The source code for the example topologies can be found
[on
GitHub]({{% githubMaster %}}/examples/src/java/org/apache/heron/examples).
The included example topologies:

* `AckingTopology.java` --- A topology with acking enabled.
* `ComponentJVMOptionsTopology.java` --- A topology that supplies JVM options
  for each component.
* `CustomGroupingTopology.java` --- A topology that implements custom grouping.
* `ExclamationTopology.java` --- A spout that emits random words to a bolt that
  then adds an exclamation mark.
* `MultiSpoutExclamationTopology.java` --- a topology with multiple spouts.
* `MultiStageAckingTopology.java` --- A three-stage topology. A spout emits to a
  bolt that then feeds to another bolt.
* `TaskHookTopology.java` --- A topology that uses a task hook to subscribe to
   event notifications.
