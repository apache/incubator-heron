This document contains information about the Heron codebase intended primarily
for developers who want to contribute to Heron. The Heron codebase lives on
[github](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master).

If you're looking for documentation about developing topologies for a Heron
cluster, see [Building Topologies](topology-development-topology-api-java) instead.

## Languages

The primary programming languages for Heron are C++, Java, and Python.

* **C++ 11** is used for most of Heron's core components, including the
[Topology Master](heron-architecture#topology-master), and
[Stream Manager](heron-architecture#stream-manager).

* **Java 11** is used primarily for Heron's [topology
API](heron-topology-concepts), and [Heron Instance](heron-architecture#heron-instance).
It is currently the only language in which topologies can be written. Instructions can be found
in [Building Topologies](../../developers/java/topologies), while documentation for the Java
API can be found [here](/api/org/apache/heron/api/topology/package-summary.html). Please note that Heron topologies do not require Java 11 and can be written in Java 7 or later.

* **Python 2** (specifically 2.7) is used primarily for Heron's [CLI interface](user-manuals-heron-cli) and UI components such as [Heron UI](user-manuals-heron-ui) and the [Heron Tracker](user-manuals-heron-tracker-runbook).

## Main Tools

* **Build tool** --- Heron uses [Bazel](http://bazel.io/) as its build tool.
Information on setting up and using Bazel for Heron can be found in [Compiling Heron](compiling-overview).

* **Inter-component communication** --- Heron uses [Protocol
Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/?hl=en) for
communication between components. Most `.proto` definition files can be found in
[`heron/proto`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/proto).

* **Cluster coordination** --- Heron relies heavily on ZooKeeper for cluster
coordination for distributed deployment, be it for [Aurora](schedulers-aurora-cluster) or for a [custom
scheduler](extending-heron-scheduler) that you build. More information on ZooKeeper
components in the codebase can be found in the [State
Management](#state-management) section below.

## Common Utilities

The [`heron/common`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/common) contains a variety of
utilities for each of Heron's languages, including useful constants, file
utilities, networking interfaces, and more.

## Cluster Scheduling

Heron supports two cluster schedulers out of the box:
[Aurora](schedulers-aurora-cluster) and a [local
scheduler](schedulers-local). The Java code for each of those
schedulers can be found in [`heron/schedulers`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/schedulers)
, while the underlying scheduler API can be found [here](/api/org/apache/heron/spi/scheduler/package-summary.html)

Info on custom schedulers can be found in [Implementing a Custom
Scheduler](extending-heron-scheduler); info on the currently available schedulers
can be found in [Deploying Heron on
Aurora](schedulers-aurora-cluster) and [Local
Deployment](schedulers-local).

## State Management

The parts of Heron's codebase related to
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) are mostly contained in
[`heron/state`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/state). There are ZooKeeper-facing
interfaces for [C++](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/state/src/cpp),
[Java](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/state/src/java), and
[Python](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/state/src/python) that are used in a variety of
Heron components.

## Topology Components

### Topology Master

The C++ code for Heron's [Topology
Master](heron-architecture#topology-master) is written in C++ can be
found in [`heron/tmaster`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tmaster).

### Stream Manager

The C++ code for Heron's [Stream
Manager](heron-architecture#stream-manager) can be found in
[`heron/stmgr`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/stmgr).

### Heron Instance

The Java code for [Heron
instances](heron-architecture#heron-instance) can be found in
[`heron/instance`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/instance).

### Metrics Manager

The Java code for Heron's [Metrics
Manager](heron-architecture#metrics-manager) can be found in
[`heron/metricsmgr`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/metricsmgr).

If you'd like to implement your own custom metrics handler (known as a **metrics
sink**), see [Implementing a Custom Metrics Sink](extending-heron-metric-sink).

## Developer APIs

### Topology API

Heron's API for writing topologies is written in Java. The code for this API can
be found in [`heron/api`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/api).

Documentation for writing topologies can be found in [Building
Topologies](topology-development-topology-api-java), while API documentation can be found
[here](/api/org/apache/heron/api/topology/package-summary.html).

### Simulator

Heron enables you to run topologies in [`Simulator`](guides-simulator-mode)
for debugging purposes.

The Java API for simulator can be found in
[`heron/simulator`](/api/org/apache/heron/simulator/package-summary.html).

### Example Topologies

Heron's codebase includes a wide variety of example
[topologies](heron-topology-concepts) built using Heron's topology API for
Java. Those examples can be found in
[`heron/examples`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/examples).

## User Interface Components

### Heron CLI

Heron has a tool called `heron` that is used to both provide a CLI interface
for [managing topologies](user-manuals-heron-cli) and to perform much of
the heavy lifting behind assembling physical topologies in your cluster.
The Python code for `heron` can be found in
[`heron/tools/cli`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tools/cli).

Sample configurations for different Heron schedulers

* [Local scheduler](schedulers-local) config can be found in [`heron/config/src/yaml/conf/local`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/config/src/yaml/conf/local),
* [Aurora scheduler](schedulers-aurora-cluster) config can be found [`heron/config/src/yaml/conf/aurora`]({https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/config/src/yaml/conf/aurora).

### Heron Tracker

The Python code for the [Heron Tracker](user-manuals-heron-tracker-runbook) can be
found in [`heron/tools/tracker`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tools/tracker).

The Tracker is a web server written in Python. It relies on the
[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) framework. You can add new HTTP
routes to the Tracker in
[`main.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tools/tracker/src/python/main.py) and
corresponding handlers in the
[`handlers`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tools/tracker/src/python/handlers) directory.

### Heron UI

The Python code for the [Heron UI](user-manuals-heron-ui) can be found in
[`heron/tools/ui`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/tools/ui).

Like Heron Tracker, Heron UI is a web server written in Python that relies on
the [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) framework. You can add new
HTTP routes to Heron UI in
[`main.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/web/source/python/main.py) and corresponding
handlers in the [`handlers`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/web/source/python/handlers)
directory.

### Heron Shell

The Python code for the [Heron Shell](user-manuals-heron-shell) can be
found in [`heron/shell`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/shell). The HTTP handlers and
web server are defined in
[`main.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/shell/src/python/main.py) while the HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, and images for the web UI can be found in the
[`assets`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/heron/shell/assets) directory.

## Tests

There are a wide variety of tests for Heron that are scattered throughout the
codebase. For more info see [Testing Heron](compiling-running-tests).
