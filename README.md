# Heron

Heron is realtime analytics platform developed by Twitter. It is the direct
successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards
compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/tutorial.html)
but with a wide array of architectural improvements. For more on the
architecture and design goals of Heron, see Heron's
[documentation](#Heron-Documentation), especially [The Architecture of
Heron](docs/concepts/architecture.md) and [Heron
Topologies](docs/concepts/topologies.md).

## Update

Currently, we are working on ensuring that Heron is easy to install and run in a
Mesos Cluster in AWS, Mesos/Aurora in AWS, and locally on a laptop. We will post updates as we progress.

## Heron Documentation

Heron's OSS documentation is not yet publicly hosted but you can view the
documentation locally. For instructions, see the `README` in the `website`
folder.
