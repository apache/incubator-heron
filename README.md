# Heron

Heron is realtime analytics platform developed by Twitter. It is the direct
successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards
compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/tutorial.html)
but with a wide array of architectural improvements.

## Update

Currently, we are working on ensuring that Heron is easy to install and run in a
Mesos Cluster in AWS, Mesos/Aurora in AWS, and locally on a laptop. We will post
updates as we progress.

## Documentation

The official documentation for Heron is currently not publicly available. You
can, however, build and run the documentation locally. More information can be
found in the [documentation
README](website/README.md).
