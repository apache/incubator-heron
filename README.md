# Heron

Heron is real-time stream processing engine developed by Twitter and open sourced in 2016. It is the direct successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Tutorial.html#topologies) but with a wide array of architectural improvements.

For more information:

* The official Heron documentation is located at [heronstreaming.io](http://heronstreaming.io)
* Official Heron resources, including conference talks, journal papers, videos, blog posts and selected press artifacts are located on the [Heron Resources](http://twitter.github.io/heron/docs/resources/) page
