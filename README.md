# Heron

> The official documentation for Heron can be found at[heronstreaming.io](https://heronstreaming.io).

Heron is real-time stream processing engine developed by Twitter and open sourced in 2016. It is the direct successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Tutorial.html#topologies) but with a wide array of architectural improvements.

Heron is:

* **Proven at Twitter scale** --- Heron has powered real-time analytics at Twitter across a wide variety of use cases since 2014
* **Flexible** --- Heron can run on a wide variety of platforms (Kubernetes, DC/OS, Mesos, on your laptop, and more).
* **Developer friendly** --- Heron processing topologies can be written using either a high-level *Streamlet API* or a lower-level *Topology API* reminiscent of the Apache Storm spouts-and-bolts model. Supported languages are Java and Python.
