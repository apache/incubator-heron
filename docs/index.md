# Heron

Heron is realtime analytics platform developed by Twitter. It is the direct
successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards
compatible with Storm's [topology API](http://storm.apache.org/tutorial.html)
but with a wide array of architectural improvements. For more on the
architecture and design goals of Heron, see [The Architecture of
Heron](docs/concepts/architecture.md) and [Heron
Topologies](docs/concepts/topologies.md).
