# Heron

Heron is realtime analytics platform developed by Twitter. It is the direct
successor of [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org), built to be backwards
compatible with Storm's [topology
API](http://storm.apache.org/tutorial.html) but with a wide array of
architectural improvements. For more on the architecture and design
goals of Heron, see [The Architecture of
Heron](concepts/architecture.md) and [Heron
Topologies](concepts/topologies.md).
