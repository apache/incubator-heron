Integration test for testing recovery from failure/restart in certain processes. Runs local-scheduler heron topology in local directory. Topology used spout which creates a file and blocks into files contents are filled. When file length !=0, spout emits each line to the bolt, which writes each line to another file. The integration-test framework tests the likeness of these two files. Currently, tests TMaster kill. 

Run main.py from heron root directory. 
e.g. python integration-test/src/python/local_test_runner/main.py
