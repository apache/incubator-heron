########### These all have default values as shown

# We would specify the unique sink-id first
sinks:
  - file-sink
  - tmaster-sink

########### Now we would specify the detailed configuration for every unique sink
########### Syntax: sink-id: - option(s)

########### option class is required as we need to instantiate a new instance by reflection
########### option flush-frequency-ms is required to invoke flush() at interval
########### option sink-restart-attempts, representsing # of times to restart a sink when it throws exceptions and dies.
###########   If this option is missed, default value 0 would be supplied; negative value represents to restart it forever.

########### Other options would be constructed as an immutable map passed to IMetricsSink's init(Map conf) as argument,
########### We would be able to fetch value by conf.get(options), for instance:
########### We could get "com.twitter.heron.metricsmgr.sink.FileSink" if conf.get("class") is called inside file-sink's instance

### Config for file-sink
file-sink:
  class: "com.twitter.heron.metricsmgr.sink.FileSink"
  flush-frequency-ms: 60000 # 1 min
  sink-restart-attempts: -1 # Forever
  filename-output: "metrics.json" # File for metrics to write to
  file-maximum: 5 # maximum number of file saved in disk

### Config for tmaster-sink
tmaster-sink:
  class: "com.twitter.heron.metricsmgr.sink.tmaster.TMasterSink"
  flush-frequency-ms: 60000
  sink-restart-attempts: -1 # Forever
  tmaster-location-check-interval-sec: 5
  tmaster-client:
    reconnect-interval-second: 5 # The re-connect interval to TMaster from TMasterClient
    # The size of packets written to TMaster will be determined by the minimal of: (a) time based (b) size based
    network-write-batch-size-bytes: 32768 # Size based, the maximum batch size in bytes to write to TMaster
    network-write-batch-time-ms: 16 # Time based, the maximum batch time in ms for Metrics Manager to write to TMaster per attempt
    network-read-batch-size-bytes: 32768 # Size based, the maximum batch size in bytes to write to TMaster
    network-read-batch-time-ms: 16 # Time based, the maximum batch time in ms for Metrics Manager to write to TMaster per attempt
    socket-send-buffer-size-bytes: 6553600 # The maximum socket's send buffer size in bytes
    socket-received-buffer-size-bytes: 8738000 # The maximum socket's received buffer size in bytes
