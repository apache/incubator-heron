This directory hosts the scripts used for compilation. 

* errors.sh - It is a perl script that takes a file and generate #defines, 
  enums used in C/C++ components of Heron

* exec_env.sh - This is generated by bazel_configure.py to capture the 
  environment variables CC and CXX. This is needed for C++ YAML compilation
  in third_party/yaml-cpp
