########### These all have default values as shown

# We would specify the unique sink-id first
sinks:
  - file-sink
  - tmaster-sink
  - prometheus-sink
  - metricscache-sink

########### Now we would specify the detailed configuration for every unique sink
########### Syntax: sink-id: - option(s)

########### option class is required as we need to instantiate a new instance by reflection
########### option flush-frequency-ms is required to invoke flush() at interval
########### option sink-restart-attempts, representsing # of times to restart a sink when it throws exceptions and dies.
###########   If this option is missed, default value 0 would be supplied; negative value represents to restart it forever.

########### Other options would be constructed as an immutable map passed to IMetricsSink's init(Map conf) as argument,
########### We would be able to fetch value by conf.get(options), for instance:
########### We could get "com.twitter.heron.metricsmgr.sink.FileSink" if conf.get("class") is called inside file-sink's instance
