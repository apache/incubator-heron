/**
 * An IBolt represents a component that takes tuples as input and produces tuples
 * as output. An IBolt can do everything from filtering to joining to functions
 * to aggregations. It does not have to process a tuple immediately and may
 * hold onto tuples to process later.
 * <p>
 * <p>A bolt's lifecycle is as follows:</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>IBolt object created on client machine. The IBolt is serialized into the topology
 * (using Java serialization) and submitted to the master machine of the cluster (Nimbus).
 * Nimbus then launches workers which deserialize the object, call prepare on it, and then
 * start processing tuples.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>If you want to parameterize an IBolt, you should set the parameter's through its
 * constructor and save the parameterization state as instance variables (which will
 * then get serialized and shipped to every task executing this bolt across the cluster).</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>When defining bolts in Java, you should use the IRichBolt interface which adds
 * necessary methods for using the Java TopologyBuilder API.</p>
