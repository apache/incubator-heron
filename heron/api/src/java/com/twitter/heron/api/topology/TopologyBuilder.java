/**
 * TopologyBuilder exposes the Java API for specifying a topology for Heron
 * to execute. Topologies are Thrift structures in the end, but since the Thrift API
 * is so verbose, TopologyBuilder greatly eases the process of creating topologies.
 * The template for creating and submitting a topology looks something like:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();
 *
 * builder.setSpout("1", new TestWordSpout(true), 5);
 * builder.setSpout("2", new TestWordSpout(true), 3);
 * builder.setBolt("3", new TestWordCounter(), 3)
 *          .fieldsGrouping("1", new Fields("word"))
 *          .fieldsGrouping("2", new Fields("word"));
 * builder.setBolt("4", new TestGlobalCount())
 *          .globalGrouping("1");
 *
 * Map conf = new HashMap();
 * conf.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_WORKERS, 4);
 *
 * HeronSubmitter.submitTopology("mytopology", conf, builder.createTopology());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Running the exact same topology in simulator (in process), and configuring it to log all tuples
 * emitted, looks like the following. Note that it lets the topology run for 10 seconds
 * before shutting down the local cluster.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();
 *
 * builder.setSpout("1", new TestWordSpout(true), 5);
 * builder.setSpout("2", new TestWordSpout(true), 3);
 * builder.setBolt("3", new TestWordCounter(), 3)
 *          .fieldsGrouping("1", new Fields("word"))
 *          .fieldsGrouping("2", new Fields("word"));
 * builder.setBolt("4", new TestGlobalCount())
 *          .globalGrouping("1");
 *
 * Map conf = new HashMap();
 * conf.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_WORKERS, 4);
 * conf.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_DEBUG, true);
 *
 * LocalCluster cluster = new LocalCluster();
 * cluster.submitTopology("mytopology", conf, builder.createTopology());
 * Utils.sleep(10000);
 * cluster.shutdown();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <p>The pattern for TopologyBuilder is to map component ids to components using the setSpout
 * and setBolt methods. Those methods return objects that are then used to declare
 * the inputs for that component.</p>
