/**
 * A Streamlet is a (potentially unbounded) ordered collection of tuples.
 * Streamlets originate from pub/sub systems(such Pulsar/Kafka), or from
 * static data(such as csv files, HDFS files), or for that matter any other
 * source. They are also created by transforming existing Streamlets using
 * operations such as map/flatMap, etc.
 * Besides the tuples, a Streamlet has the following properties associated with it
 * a) name. User assigned or system generated name to refer the streamlet
 * b) nPartitions. Number of partitions that the streamlet is composed of. Thus the
 *    ordering of the tuples in a Streamlet is wrt the tuples within a partition.
 *    This allows the system to distribute  each partition to different nodes across the cluster.
 * A bunch of transformations can be done on Streamlets(like map/flatMap, etc.). Each
 * of these transformations operate on every tuple of the Streamlet and produce a new
 * Streamlet. One can think of a transformation attaching itself to the stream and processing
 * each tuple as they go by. Thus the parallelism of any operator is implicitly determined
 * by the number of partitions of the stream that it is operating on. If a particular
 * tranformation wants to operate at a different parallelism, one can repartition the
 * Streamlet before doing the transformation.
