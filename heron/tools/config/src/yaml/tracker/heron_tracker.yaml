# Configs for heron-tracker

## Contains the sources where the states are stored.
# Each source has these attributes:
# 1. type - type of state manager (zookeeper or file, etc.)
# 2. name - name to be used for this source
# 3. hostport - only used to connect to zk, must be of the form 'host:port'
# 4. rootpath - where all the states are stored
# 5. tunnelhost - if ssh tunneling needs to be established to connect to it
statemgrs:
  -
    type: "file"
    name: "local"
    rootpath: "~/.herondata/repository/state/local"
    tunnelhost: "localhost"
#
# To use 'localzk', launch a zookeeper server locally
# and create the following path:
#   *. /heron/topologies
#
#  -
#    type: "zookeeper"
#    name: "localzk"
#    hostport: "localhost:2181"
#    rootpath: "/heron"
#    tunnelhost: "localhost"

#
# To specify multiple Zookeeper Nodes for fallback
# -
#    type: "zookeeper"
#    name: "zk"
#    hostport: "remote-zk-1:2181,remote-zk-2:2181,remote-zk-3:2181"
#    rootpath: "/heron"
#    tunnelhost: "remote-tunnel"

# The URL that points to a topology's metrics dashboard.
# This value can use following parameters to create a valid
# URL based on the topology. All parameters are self-explanatory.
# These are found in the execution state of the topology.
#
#   ${CLUSTER}
#   ${ENVIRON}
#   ${TOPOLOGY}
#   ${ROLE}
#   ${USER}
#
# This is a sample, and should be changed to point to corresponding dashboard.
#
# viz.url.format: "http://localhost/${CLUSTER}/${ENVIRON}/${TOPOLOGY}/${ROLE}/${USER}"
