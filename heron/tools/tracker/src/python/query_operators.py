class Subtract(Operator):
  """Subtract Operator. Has same conditions as division operator.
  This is to keep the API simple.
  Accepts two arguments, both can be univariate or multivariate.
  1. constant will be considered as a constant timeseries for all applicable timestamps
  2. Operator - can be any concrete subclass of Operator on which "execute" can
     be called which returns a list of Metrics.

  Three main cases are:
  1. When both operands are multivariate -
     a. Subtract operation will be done on matching data, that is, with same instance id.
     b. If the instances in both the operands do not match, error is thrown.
     c. Returns multivariate timeseries, each representing the result of subtraction
        on the two corresponding timeseries.
  2. When one operand is univariate, and other is multivariate -
     a. This includes subtraction by constants as well.
     b. The univariate operand will participate with all timeseries in multivariate.
     c. The instance information of the multivariate timeseries will be preserved in the result.
     d. Returns multivariate timeseries.
  3. When both operands are univariate.
     a. Instance information is ignored in this case
     b. Returns univariate timeseries which is the result of subtraction operation."""
