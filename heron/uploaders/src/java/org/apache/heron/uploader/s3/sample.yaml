# uploader class for transferring the topology jar/tar files to storage
heron.class.uploader:         org.apache.heron.uploader.s3.S3Uploader

# S3 bucket to put the jar file into
heron.uploader.s3.bucket:     heron-topologies-company-com

# By default the path prefix will be empty and the full path would be s3://#{bucket}/#{topology_name}/topology.tar.gz
# This allows you to prepend a prefix to the path to specify a sub-folder in which cased the full path would be:
# s3://#{bucket}/#{prefix}/#{topology_name}/topology.tar.gz
# heron.uploader.s3.path_prefix: path/prefix

# By default, assume AWS S3. However, you can specify a custom url if you are using a
# S3 compatible storage layer (or using a reverse proxy for accessing S3).
# heron.uploader.s3.uri: hostname:port
# If you want to access S3 through a http proxy, use
# heron.upload.s3.proxy_uri: http://username:password@hostname:port
# username and password are optional

# Specifies a custom region - see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/regions/Regions.html#US_EAST_1
# heron.uploader.s3.region : meh

# AWS Credentials
# By default the S3 Uploader will use the Default Credential Provider Chain for accessing the S3 bucket -
# see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#using-the-default-credential-provider-chain
# However you have the option to directly specify aws credentials:
# heron.uploader.s3.access_key: access_key
# heron.uploader.s3.secret_key: secret_access_key
# Alternatively to directly specifying aws credentials, you can specify the aws profile
# in case you have multiple AWS profiles in your credentials file (~/.aws/credentials):
# heron.uploader.s3.aws_profile: profile_name
