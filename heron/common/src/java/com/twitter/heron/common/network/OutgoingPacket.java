/**
 * Defines OutgoingPacket
 * <p>
 * TODO -- Sanjeev will add a detailed description of this application level protocol later
 * <p>
 * When allocating the ByteBuffer, we have two options:
 * 1. Normal java heap buffer by invoking ByteBuffer.allocate(...),
 * 2. Native heap buffer by invoking ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(...),
 * Though it would require extra memory copies in java heap buffer, after experiments trying to use
 * both of them, we choose to use normal java heap buffer, since:
 * 1. It is unsafe to use direct buffer:
 * -- Direct buffer would not trigger gc;
 * -- We could not control when to release the resources of direct buffer explicitly;
 * -- It is hard to guarantee direct buffer would not break limitation of native heap,
 * i.e. not throw OutOfMemoryError.
 * <p>
 * 2. Experiments are done by using direct buffer and the resources saving is negligible:
 * -- Direct buffer would save, in our scenarios, less than 1% of RAM;
 * -- Direct buffer could save 30%~50% cpu of Gateway thread.
 * However, the cpu used by Gateway thread is negligible,
 * less than 2% out of the whole usage in worst case.
 * -- The extra copy is within JVM boundary; it is pretty fast.
