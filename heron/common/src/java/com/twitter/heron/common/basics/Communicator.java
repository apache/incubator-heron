 * LinkedTransferQueue, so you could still offer items even if remainingCapacity() &lt;= 0.
 * <p>
 * We use an unbound queue since for every time user's bolt's executing or spout's emitting tuples,
 * it is possible that unbounded # of tuples could be generated. And we could not stop them since
 * the logic is inside their jars. So in order to avoid enqueue failure, we need an unbound queue.
 * <p>
 * However, in order to avoid GC issues and keep high performance, we would have a dynamical tuning
 * Queue's expected capacity, see updateExpectedAvailableCapacity() below.
