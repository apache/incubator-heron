/**
 * This file defines the ChannelHelper class.
 * Heron Client and Server use the ChannelHelper class for doing all the reads/writes. A ChannelHelper
 * is a a placeholder for all network and io related information about a socket descriptor. It takes
 * care of async read/write of packets. Typical ways of instantiating ChannelHelper are described
 * below in a client and server settings.
 * <p>
 * SERVER
 * After an accept event, the server creates a ChannelHelper object giving it a proper option
 * ISelectHandler selectHandler = new Server();
 * NIOLoop looper = new NIOLooper();
 * SocketChannel socketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.accept();
 * ChannelHelper channelHelper = new ChannelHelper(looper, selectHandler, socketChannel, options);
 * After this point, you could use read()/write() to access socket
 * <p>
 * CLIENT
 * After a successful connect, the client creates a ChannelHelper object giving it a proper option
 * ISelectHandler selectHandler = new Client();
 * NIOLoop looper = new NIOLooper();
 * SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open();
 * socketChannel.connect(endpoint);
 * ChannelHelper channelHelper = new ChannelHelper(looper, selectHandler, socketChannel, options);
 * After this point, you could use read()/write() to access socket.
 * <p>
 * Notice: The SocketChannelHelper would work only when the socketChannel is connected and opened.
 * Higher level logic needs to guarantee SocketChannelHelper's methods are invoked within proper
 * SocketChannel state.
