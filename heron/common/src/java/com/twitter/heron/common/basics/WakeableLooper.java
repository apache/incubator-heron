/**
 * A WakeableLooper is a class that could:
 * Block the thread when doWait() is called and unblock
 * when the wakeUp() is called or the waiting time exceeds the timeout.
 * It could execute timer event
 * <p>
 * The WakeableLooper will execute in a while loop unless the exitLoop() is called. And in every
 * execution, it will execute runOnce(), which will:
 * 1. doWait(), which in fact is implemented by selector.select(timeout), and it will be wake up if other threads
 * wake it up, it meets the timeout, one channel is selected, or the current thread is interrupted.
 * 2. run executeTasksOnWakeup(), which is a list of Runnable, e.g. tasks added to run every time. We could add tasks
 * even during executionTasksOnWakeup, but the task added will be executed next time we run executeTasksOnwakeup().
 * Notice: you could just add tasks into it but not remove tasks from it.
 * 3. trigger the timers, which is a priority queue of {@code TimerTask}, the {@code TimerTask}
 * will be removed after execution.
 * <p>
 * So to use this class, user could add the persistent tasks, one time tasks and timer tasks as many
 * as they want.
