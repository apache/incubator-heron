///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This file defines the BaseClient class.
// Each type of Heron client inherits from this class. The various
// derivations differ in what sort of protocol they speak. The only
// implementation is the Client class that speaks the Heron
// ProtocolBuffer Packets.
// The BaseClient knows how to bind and listen to a particular port.
// It tries to connect to a destination server and calls various
// callbacks like HandleConnect_Base and HandleClose_Base when
// the connection connects/closes.
// Derived classes differ in what sort of connections they init, and
// how requests are handled. Please see client.h
// for details on how to use the BaseClient class. No other classes should
// derive from the BaseClient class.
