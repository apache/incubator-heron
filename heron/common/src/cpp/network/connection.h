/**
 * A Connection is a placeholder for all network and io related
 * information about a socket descriptor. It takes care of async read/write
 * of Packets. Typical ways of instantiating connections are described
 * below in a client and server settings.
 *
 * SERVER
 * After an accept event, the server creates a Connection object giving it
 * an established end point. It then registers for events on this connection
 * like handling a new packet and handling close. It then calls the Start method
 * of the Connection to begin reads/writes from the connection.
 * int fd = accept(...);
 * ConnectionEndPoint* endpoint = new ConnectionEndPoint;
 * ....init endpoint with fd....
 * Connection* conn = new Connection(endpoint, options, ss);
 * conn->registerForNewPacket(...);
 * conn->RegisterForClose(...);
 * conn->Start();
 * After this point, the connection invokes the appropriate callbacks when
 * events occur.
 *
 * CLIENT
 * After a successful connect, the client creates a Connection object giving it
 * an established end point. It register callbacks for events and then invokes
 * Start.
 * int fd = connect(...);
 * ConnectionEndPoint* endpoint = new ConnectionEndPoint;
 * .... init the fd and sockaddr of the endpoint ....
 * Connection* conn = new Connection(endpoint, options, ss);
 * conn->registerForNewPacket(...)
 * conn->RegisterForClose(...);
 * conn->Start();
 * After this point the connection invokes the appropriate callbacks when
 * events occur.
