/*
 * Client class definition
 * Given a host/port, the client tries to connect to the host port.
 * It calls various virtual methods when events happen. The events are
 * HandleConnect:- When the connect process completes, this method is invoked.
 *                 Applications can send a greeting message, etc.
 * HandleClose:- We call this function when the underlying connection closes.
 *               A connection can close either because the user explictly
 *               did a close using the Stop API or because of a read/write
 *               error encountered by the underlying connection.
 *               Derived classes can cleanup stuff in this method
 * HandleResponse:- Whenever a response from the server arrives, this method
 *                  is called. Derived classes can parse the response and
 *                  use the response in this method.
 * Derived classes can use the SendRequest method to send a request to the
 * server. They can use the Stop to explicitly close a connection.
