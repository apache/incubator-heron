 * CountDownLatch is similar to java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch.
 * It is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads
 * to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes
 *
 * A CountDownLatch is initialized with a given count. The await methods block
 * until the current count reaches zero due to invocations of the countDown()
 * method, after which all waiting threads are released and any subsequent
 * invocations of await return immediately. This is a one-shot phenomenon,
 * the count cannot be reset.
