/**
 * Singleton object which installs a global exception handler.
 *
 * When an object of this type is created globally, it will install itself
 * as the default exception handler, and will print out the exception then
 * call abort() if it is called.  It knows how to print out stack traces
 * for Lx_ErrorException.  If it is the first object instantiated, it will
 * also catch any exceptions thrown during construction of global objects.
 *
 * To use, put these two lines very first in the C++ file containing main():
 *
 *    #include "errhandler/gexception.h"
 *    Global_Exception_Handler       globalExceptionHandler;
 *
 * This object is a singleton, so creating more than one will not be harmful.
 *
 * This is based on an idea from IBM:
 *    http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cppexcep.html
 *
