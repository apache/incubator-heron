  """EventLooper is a Python implementation of WakeableLooper.java

  EventLooper is a class for scheduling recurring tasks that could:

  - Block the thread when ``do_wait()`` is called
  - Unblock it when ``wake_up()`` is called or the waiting time exceeds the timeout
  - Execute timer event

  The EventLooper will execute in a while loop, unless ``exit_loop()`` is called.
  In every execution, it will execute ``_run_once()``, inside which it will:

  - ``do_wait()`` to perform blocking tasks, which will be waken up if ``wake_up()`` is called, or
    time exceeds the timeout, or an event is successfully dispatched.
  - run ``_execute_wakeup_tasks()``, in which registered wakeup tasks are executed. Note that these
    tasks will be executed every loop after wakeup.
  - run ``_trigger_timers()``, in which expired timers are executed and removed.

  Note that the EventLooper class is NOT designed to be thread-safe,
  except for ``wake_up()`` method.
