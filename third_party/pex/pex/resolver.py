  :keyword fetchers: (optional) A list of :class:`Fetcher` objects for locating packages.  If
    unspecified, the default is to look for packages on PyPI.
  :keyword interpreter: (optional) A :class:`PythonInterpreter` object to use for building
    distributions and for testing distribution compatibility.
  :keyword platform: (optional) A PEP425-compatible platform string to use for filtering
    compatible distributions.  If unspecified, the current platform is used, as determined by
    `Platform.current()`.
  :keyword context: (optional) A :class:`Context` object to use for network access.  If
    unspecified, the resolver will attempt to use the best available network context.
  :type threads: int
  :keyword precedence: (optional) An ordered list of allowable :class:`Package` classes
    to be used for producing distributions.  For example, if precedence is supplied as
    ``(WheelPackage, SourcePackage)``, wheels will be preferred over building from source, and
    eggs will not be used at all.  If ``(WheelPackage, EggPackage)`` is suppplied, both wheels and
    eggs will be used, but the resolver will not resort to building anything from source.
  :keyword cache: (optional) A directory to use to cache distributions locally.
  :keyword cache_ttl: (optional integer in seconds) If specified, consider non-exact matches when
    resolving requirements.  For example, if ``setuptools==2.2`` is specified and setuptools 2.2 is
    available in the cache, it will always be used.  However, if a non-exact requirement such as
    ``setuptools>=2,<3`` is specified and there exists a setuptools distribution newer than
    cache_ttl seconds that satisfies the requirement, then it will be used.  If the distribution
    is older than cache_ttl seconds, it will be ignored.  If ``cache_ttl`` is not specified,
    resolving inexact requirements will always result in making network calls through the
    ``context``.
  :returns: List of :class:`pkg_resources.Distribution` instances meeting ``requirements``.
  :raises Unsatisfiable: If ``requirements`` is not transitively satisfiable.
  :raises Untranslateable: If no compatible distributions could be acquired for
    a particular requirement.

  This method improves upon the setuptools dependency resolution algorithm by maintaining sets of
  all compatible distributions encountered for each requirement rather than the single best
  distribution encountered for each requirement.  This prevents situations where ``tornado`` and
  ``tornado==2.0`` could be treated as incompatible with each other because the "best
  distribution" when encountering ``tornado`` was tornado 3.0.  Instead, ``resolve`` maintains the
  set of compatible distributions for each requirement as it is encountered, and iteratively filters
  the set.  If the set of distributions ever becomes empty, then ``Unsatisfiable`` is raised.

  .. versionchanged:: 0.8
    A number of keywords were added to make requirement resolution slightly easier to configure.
    The optional ``obtainer`` keyword was replaced by ``fetchers``, ``translator``, ``context``,
    ``threads``, ``precedence``, ``cache`` and ``cache_ttl``, also all optional keywords.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.0
    The ``translator`` and ``threads`` keywords have been removed.  The choice of threading
    policy is now implicit.  The choice of translation policy is dictated by ``precedence``
    directly.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.0
    ``resolver`` is now just a wrapper around the :class:`Resolver` and :class:`CachingResolver`
    classes.
